QA130-Want to build strength? Start with a stable foundation.mp3

Ben Pakulski: Hey, everybody, welcome to a special Q&A version of the Muscle Intelligence podcast, I'm your host Ben Pakulski always from this podcast or on living your greatest life in a body that you absolutely love.

Ben Pakulski: I get coaches coming to me from all around the world on orders of magnitude. And this is not just meant for coaches. But this is meant for anyone looking to optimize their body and the mind. And coaches come to me and say, you know, Ben, where should I start with my clients? And the reason I say this is not just meant for coaches, because if you're anyone who's exercising ever, whether it be running cross fit, bodybuilding, weightlifting like that, there's a certain foundational requirement as a human being to optimize your biomechanics, the way you move your physiology, your psychology, and all these things are integrated. These are inextricably linked. You can't separate. So it's important to acknowledge that if there was one or two things that you knew, if you did these things, everything else would get better. Would you do them? And most of all, of course, well, most people are trying to build muscle on a structure, on a foundation that's unstable. Most people are trying to get strong on a foundation that's unstable. So we're trying to do things that ultimately are asking a high level of performance of their body without first laying a solid foundation. I got to tell you today what a solid foundation is. And you guys, I've heard my moniker breathe, walk and meditate. And I didn't pick those haphazardly and I didn't even order them that way haphazardly, although it does roll off the tongue. I want to talk to you yesterday about the implications of breathing and walking on your high level performance.

Ben Pakulski: I know that doesn't sound sexy, but I promise if you stick with him by the end of it, you're going to start to understand this at a deeper level and understand why this is a more important component than you may believe. So let's think about this. When people talk about functional movement. What is functional movement? Well, it's like things you would do in like sports and stuff like that. Really?

Ben Pakulski: No, that's not correct. So the only functional things we do is you make the two most functional things reduce you and things are breathing and walking. Right. Those are the two functional movements as a human being. There's a natural biomechanical pattern in our biomechanical rhythm, if you will. That's a necessary part of both of those functional movements. And guess what? Ninety nine percent of people I mean, do them wrong. And is that very, very subjective? Of course it is. But there's some there's varying degrees of accuracy of varying degrees of quote unquote. Right. But I want to walk you through today some really simple realities with respect to walking and breathing that everyone should be paying attention to. So if I breathe, you know, X number of times in a day, you guys won't do the math. I don't know what is. It's probably a thousand more. More than a thousand, actually.

Ben Pakulski: So how many times do we even if if one of them or if all of them ultimately are dysfunctional, meaning I'm supposed to be breathing through this deep expansive breath cycle whereby my diaphragm expand, expands down into my stomach into what's called methodical lumbar fascia or cavity. And my rib cage should be expanding my sturnum lifts up as I inhale.

Ben Pakulski: It's like a pump. And then as I exhale, they all collapse down and shrink down into this well, like a shrimp shrivel down balloon. Right. So that inhale the balloon expands and gets bigger as the exhale balloon gets smaller, diaphragm comes up under my ribcage. Now, if at any point this becomes inhibited or labored or, you know, to use the catch phrase, dysfunctional, every movement that gets started stacked on top of that is by definition also dysfunctional.

Ben Pakulski: So if I have a limitation on my ability to move my spine, my ability to move my shoulders enough and even my ability, my hips breathing can be the is, I should say, the foundational piece that everyone should be addressing before attempting to address a dysfunctional shoulder or a dysfunctional spine or anything like that. If you're breathing, patterns are contributing to the dysfunction of your movement.

Ben Pakulski: The likelihood of improving movement goes becomes less and less and less. So what is functional breathing look like? Well, let's think about this. And I've been just thinking about this lately. So as a child, if you are relatively inactive and you're developing your sensory motor cortex, your body is developing all these different movement patterns and almost a brain level at a nervous system level and at a muscular level, you're relatively inactive. And so these parts of your body maybe don't develop to full capacity. That's a very different reality as to how your body is going to develop and express as an adult. So if you have a child who tends to do a lot of physical.

Ben Pakulski: Sports, long-Distance running things like that or anything that requires you'd actually use the full capacity of your lungs. They're going to start to develop the full capacity of these breathing muscles. Right. We have muscles that cause inhalation. We have muscles that cause exhalation. It doesn't matter what they are or realize. If I have full inhalation cycles, elation, expansions, all those muscles reach this this lengthened position and they learn. Your brain learns that, hey, we're stable here. We're strong here. We can access these extremely lengthen positions as you exhale all the way. The brain comes into these really shortened positions and the nervous system learns, hey, I can contract here, I'm stable here, I'm strong here. I can access these things with relative ease. Now, whether you're a child or an adult and you don't access these positions for a long period of time. Your brain takes on this mentality of use it or lose. Right. So if you don't use it, don't go to these big spending breath cycles or these big constricted breath cycles in the diaphragm and intercostals. Guess what? Don't get used. They atrophy the shrink and they get. So it starts to happen as you start to get just a little tighter and through our spine, a little tighter in the muscles around the ribcage and the joints around the ribcage and shoulders.

Ben Pakulski: So. The necessity of implementing a deep, expanded birth cycle as a foundation of all human movement through the upper body particularly can't be overstated. So think about what happens as I take a really deep breath.

Ben Pakulski: Let's say I take a deep breath and I'm on the order of 60 to 80 seconds, six zero to eight zero. Really big. Like a really big on a balloon. Really big. So all your intercostals are really expanding this, ray start to expand the abdominal muscles, start to expand all these muscles, expand your spine extends. So you go into a thoracic extension.

Ben Pakulski: And then as I blow out a diaphragm comes back up into my underneath my rib cage, my external obliques contract down my spine goes into flexion. I'm getting this natural pumping movement motion going up my spine. And these movements are literally the foundation of human function, human biology, human mechanics.

Ben Pakulski: And ultimately, they help control human physiology and psychology. And so when you look at breathing as a foundational piece of human physiology or human function, there's many facets.

Ben Pakulski: But the one that seems to be disregarded in many performance rooms or many therapy rooms is this necessity that breathing has to be considered just like any other muscle, in that it needs to be able to access and lengthen muscle, lengthen muscle position and a shorten muscle position.

Ben Pakulski: So I want to be able to fill up my my diaphragm, fill up my abdominals, fill up my lungs all the way up into the upper lobe. So if you can imagine three sets of lobes yet your lower lobes, which sits down methodical lumbar cavity, and then you've got your midland's, which is kind of under the rib cage and your upper lobes set up here just into the clavicle. So all of those have the potential to fill with oxygen as we breathe and ultimately allow for gas exchange in the body. Most people don't use their entire lung capacity, and that's not a bad thing. In general, you don't always want to be using your lung capacity, but it would be nice when you need it to have access to it, but have access to it.

Ben Pakulski: It means I need to train it. I need to do it. I need to go there sometimes and get the levels and reasons are extensive and massive. But as a foundational piece of human movement, I want each and every one of you to acknowledge that if that range of motion, which should look like a balloon blowing up all the way to his expanded position and all the way it's contracted exhale position. If it doesn't look like that. All movements of the upper body become affected and limited by it. So if you're someone who's lacking shoulder mobility in any plane, if you're someone who's lacking spinal mobility, even if someone is experiencing neck pain, any of those manifestations or even just ultimately a body that isn't developing in proportion, maybe you have a hard time building up pecs or our time building certain muscles. The reason you can't build muscles is because your training doesn't allow you to access those muscles. You can't get into the range of motion, so therefore you can't train. And obviously you should stretch.

Ben Pakulski: Ok, maybe people go oh you know, you got to do some mobility work. OK, maybe. Well, what's the foundation of mobility work?

Ben Pakulski: Well, how about a functional breathing cycle that allows you to access a completely expanded diaphragm, musculature it quickly expanded ribcage, skeletal system and muscular system, which is then if you go through all the things that happen. Take a deep breath and let's just go through that quickly. Deep breath in my spine extends. You can feel that as you do that you should feel your rib cage starting to expand. So typically, like think of it like pouring a pitcher of water to glass to the lower lungs kind of fill first and then the mid lungs that eventually comes way up here in the upper lungs. I kind of want you to breathe that way intentionally and, you know, you'll feel at your side. So you kind of breathing out laterally into the sides and this frontal play and you start to start filling in your back. If you're doing it really all your back starts pushing the ribs in the back, start pushing out.

Ben Pakulski: And that's going to allow your all those muscles to start to expand. So when I'm ticking deeper than my spine extends at the thoracic spine, my hips open, so my hip joints actually externally rotate. So I go into more of a position, extra rotation. And ultimately my scapula kind of sit down my back and they move down my spine a little bit and exhale.

Ben Pakulski: I'm going into position flexion. So my spine is around forward and it's slight. I'm exaggerating just visual purposes. But now with that my rib, my scapula goes up, my shoulders roll forward and my pelvis internally rotates. So all these things are happening just through the breath cycle. Obviously, the shorter your breath cycle, the shorter those movements happen to be. And eventually, if the breaths cycles always very very short, you never access these lengthen cycles. Well, those movements will become our default. So if you're someone who tends to just breathe a little bit and you never really do a lot of aerobic work and you're never breathing really heavy in challenging those muscles of inhalation and exhalation.

Ben Pakulski: Well, that limited breathing pattern will become your default. So therefore your body will start to limit ranges, emotion that match whatever piece or whatever part of the breast cycle you tend to live in. So that means if I tend to be always on the high end of my inhalation, just breathe shortly there while slightly inhaled. My body's going to express this having rib cage that's kind of flared up scapula. It's kind of sitting back and down me. My shoulders rolled back, then my up my arms maybe a little externally rotated and my hips are extra meaning kind of turned out to the side. If I'm someone who spends more time, we'll call Exhale strategy. So the bottom of my exhale, I tend to breathe there more often. My hips will be internally rotated. My shoulders will be internally rotated. And my scapula upper lip rotated. So kind of sitting up almost into a shrugging, those would be the people who have a hard time usually building up our pecs, maybe have a little issue, upper back pain, sometimes hip pain, and all these things can manifest just as a result of limited or dysfunctional breathing patterns. So even though as a therapist out there, massage therapists, or at least whoever is working on you or coach/trainer, you're going after trying to improve somebody's mobility. You're not going after the cause. Right. So you're going after the symptom and not the cause. And oftentimes, if not always, the breath is the gateway to unlocking improved mobility, stability and ultimately accessing these rooms so you can build them.

Ben Pakulski: So hopefully that's starting to paint a picture for you guys. And I know sometimes people don't learn very well, literally, and we get a visual. So unfortunate. Don't have a visual because it is a podcast.

Ben Pakulski: But just thinking about the inhale breath being the breath of expansions like spent everything ribcage gets bigger, my shoulders roll back, my hips roll open. I'm really expanding.

Ben Pakulski: Exhales The breath of contraction so I can track down shows, kind of roll forward and up pelvis kind of rolls in, spine crunches forward. Now an ideal and healthy human being and an athlete has access to both ends of those. It doesn't mean they live in both ends. It doesn't mean I'm always trying to breathe sixty seconds in, 60 seconds out on every breath. But I need to be able to access that. And there's a lot of ways we can get into looking and seeing which kind of manifestation you are. But obviously not really taking place on a podcast. And there's another level to this, right? What if one side is really, really expanded all the time?

Ben Pakulski: I mean, let's say you maybe you breathe in to one side more than the other, why one side is really tight for whatever reason. That can be from trauma, that can be from injury, that can be from any number of things. But if you tend to breathe in one side more than the other. Well, what's going to happen to the muscle? The bones. Right. So the muscle skills muscle system moves the skeletal system so muscles move bones. So if one side of your body is really expansive, it's able to contract and move, and the other side is kind of tight because that can affect everything you do. Right. It's going to start impacting everything you do from exercise to walking to sleeping to even just breathing so that you can access that side. Well, is the solution to stretch? Is the solution to go, hey, I have a scoliosis, I need to go get my spine stretched? Or is this again? I'm not saying clinically that this is cured of scoliosis, but I'm saying there's certainly some implications to be considered that, say, my muscles move my bones. And if my muscles are tight on one side or the other or just in general, it can massively impact on my skeletal system. So considering breathing as the primary.

Ben Pakulski: Access point to better mobility through the upper body. Now, don't spend too much time on this because I want to get a short.

Ben Pakulski: So just thinking about that. So do you have a deep breath practice allowing your diaphram, trying to expand and contract? And if you don't, maybe it's a aerobic work. Maybe it's doing some high intensity aerobics stuff that you're very consciously breathing down into your diaphragm and extending that breath cycle to improve those muscles of respiration, improve the inhale and exhalation muscles - you don't need to know the names. It doesn't even matter. But just like how long can you inhale?

Ben Pakulski: How long can you exhale? Can you comfortably hold your breath in those positions? And this is why I've taken a liking to yoga as yoga. The way I practice is a five minimum five count. And usually it's a very slow five count in a very slow five count out and then a hold on each end and maintaining some uncomfortably molded position ultimately and trying to breathe functionally into these places that you lack mobility. So I'm doing some type of twisting movement and I can feel something's tight.

Ben Pakulski: I'm intentionally trying to breathe into it, relax and get out of it.

Ben Pakulski: And ultimately trying to allow your body to relax the musculature in that area. So connecting your breath with your movement is a huge opportunity that exist for all of us now not to spend too much time on it. Like I said, but walking. Here's another thing. So if you don't walk functionally. Right. So how many times a day do you take steps? Most of us should average 10000 plus steps a day. So if that's in any way dysfunctional. What does that mean? Well, maybe your feet are flat. That's dysfunctional. Maybe your feet don't move because you've been wearing shoes for too long. That's dysfunctional. If you end up slap footing so your heel strikes, you slap, slap, slap. Well, everything up the chain is going to be dysfunctional. So from the way your hip works to what your knee works now, the way your back and shoulders ultimately work. So every single step we take needs to be considerate of what's actually happening at the level of the foot, what's happening to level the knee, the hip and maybe the rotation that exists of the spine.

Ben Pakulski: So it's a lot of stuff you guys can do to start paying attention to the strength of your feet in the first and most important thing is one of the footwear you're using. Right. So if the footwear doesn't allow your foot to move similar to like a hand. Right. You should be able to do stuff like this. And I'm sitting here kind of like I'm playing a piano with my fingers or I'm expanding my hand like like a web of a goose or something contracting. And then being able to access all those different positions of the foot is imperative to improving foot function. Now, what is foot function matter? Well, what is meant to be a shock absorber. Right. So I have all these muscles functioning my foot. I have a nice, healthy arch that almost acts like a shock absorber. So when I land on the ground, it should it should cushion my knees and hips. If I'm flat footed all the shock absorber, muscles are gone. So just boom, boom shock. And not only is it no longer absorbing the shock, that's going to then be dissipated through my knees and my hips. It's also limiting that mobility that's supposed to happen, that natural pronation that happens when you land on the outside of your foot, and roll to the middle. There's a rotation that happens all the way up through the knees.

Ben Pakulski: So if I'm just slap footing, the rotation that's supposed to happen. The foot doesn't level with them. The range motion becomes limited, oftentimes at the knee and the hip. So that like, oh, gosh, you know, my hips feel really, really tight. Yeah. No shit. I do this because your body doesn't go through these ranges of motion. You use it or lose it if you don't go through these ranges. Guess what happens. They break.

Ben Pakulski: You don't get to access them anymore. Your body goes, sorry, man. You can't even walk with that little amount of force that's being a part of your body with walking. You can't even get these ranges. And now you put weight on my back and asked me to go through these internal extra rotation movies that have to happen at the hips, knees and ankles. And you can do it and you can do with walking and now you're gonna add weight your back? No, thank you. Not into it. Your body goes. Your brain says eh eh tighten up or we're gonna get hurt. Can't do it. Can't sustain force output with this amount of resistance to your brain. But you. Because you're going to wheel your way through it, you're really strong willed. So I'm going to do it anyways. I'm going to I'm going to go through the pain. Your body gets tighter because your body increases neural inflammation. Oh, gosh. I'm going to get tighter and I start to get pain. The range of motion gets even tighter. And then I end up hating exercise because, gosh, you know, that didn't really enjoy that. I don't like that exercise. That hurts me. And I'm sure it does because you didn't do anything that's foundationally essential to improve your mobility and stability.

Ben Pakulski: So without letting this drag on too long, I hope to keep this under 20 minutes, letting it drag on too long.

Ben Pakulski: I highly suggest each and every one of you begin to implement a breathing, walking and meditation practice into your life. So meditation is exercise for your brain. You can't center your brain to have a thought for that lasts ultimately minutes, if not hours. You are not highly performing human being and you're not a highly functioning human being. You're just not. You're not performing at your best. And that's not a shot.

Ben Pakulski: That's just the reality. We're trying to get your brain centered. We're trying to get your brain to where you can focus on a single point. So what does meditation look like? Listen, if you can't meditate. Turn your breath. Practice. The one we just briefly introduced. Into a meditation practice. And here's what you got to do. Pay attention to where you feel the breath. Some of you that can be the tip of the nose. Some of you that can be up to your chest. Some of you that could be in your diaphragm. And I want you to just pay attention to it. For the first couple of days, just like where I feel this. And just focus on that. And if you can focus on that. Can I feel it in my nose? Well I want to feel more like my my diaphragm. If I could start to kind of orchestrate it a little bit, I could start to move it a little bit. Can we move deeper into my diaphram? And then when I relax I can let my diaphram come up and inside underneath my ribcage, OK, I can focus on that feeling and maybe I can direct it. Oh gosh. Y'know I feel a bit tightness on this side of my right side I'm gonna nhale and try to send more the air to that side.

Ben Pakulski: All you're really doing effectively is allowing the muscles on that side to expand.

Ben Pakulski: So why is that useful? Well, now, instead of breathing into one side and creating this dysfunctional breathing pattern, maybe just by paying attention to my breath, I can improve the functional breathing, the biomechanical requirement or necessity of the breath and turn that into the meditation. Right. So you see this single point of focus is what meditation is to you. You're accomplishing two benefits. You have a single point of focus and you have what's called interception, which is paying attention to the inside of your body rather than the outside. So breath can exist, the nose breath can exist in your mind. You're breathing your mouth, whatever it is. But really, we want to create this nasal breath that allows us to start paying attention to what's happening inside of our body.

Ben Pakulski: And what you'll notice is if you start getting really good at it or at least diligent with it, like your spine kind of feels a little bit longer when you inhale and exhale.

Ben Pakulski: And I'mm actually pulling my pelvic floor up and letting the diaphragm come up inside, my posture feels better. Gosh, now my shoulder mobility feels better. My spinal mobility feels better. My shoulders don't hurt as much press. I do these exercises. It's really interesting. I don't know why that is. I think that guy then said something about gosh this might help me. Yes, it absolutely will. So if you're someone who suffers with shoulder pain, spinal pain or hip pain and you don't have a breath, practice I promise you, stop looking for the pill, the potion or the physical therapist or whatever it is, who's going to fix this for you if you're not wanting to do the work on your own to improve your breath and your feet and your hips, ultimately, nothing's going to change. So this is a big part of my muscle building message, the message of Muscle Intelligence. It's not just about how hard you work. It's learning to lay the foundational pieces that can improve your body's function at a base level. And gosh, if you look at the implications of the breath on the psychology and just the physiology and stress management and be able to access your brain, that's a whole different conversation for different podcast. But the implications are literally second to none. So guys if you're looking for things that are going to have the greatest bang for your buck in changing your life from ability to perform and ability to manage stress and abilities to create deep focus, the breath is the key.

Ben Pakulski: And here's the cool thing. You could actually turn a walking practice into something that includes all of the breathing, the walking, and the meditating at once. How do you do it? Go for a walk. Leave your phone at home. Unplug your headphones and just walk.

Ben Pakulski: Pay attention to how your feet hit the ground. Pay attention to your breath cycle. Can you extend the breath cycle? Can you shorten the breast cycle? Can you pay attention to the interoception? How the body feels in the inside the diaphragm feels as expands into the belly as it contracts up under the under the ribcage. You pay attention to that. Maybe the next meditation is just going to pay attention. Once I've kind of locked in that breath, I don't get to pay attention to just what I hear or the sounds here. And I'm just really going to zero in on those and maybe from there I'm gonna cylce to what I feel. Feel a sun beating gets my face and the warmth of the sun causing the beat of sweat to roll down my back. And I'm feeling the pressure of my feet is in the floor. I'm feeling the muscles of my glutes contract. As I push into the floor, I take my long steps. I'm feeling my spine rotated, my arms swaying and feeling the material of my shirt rubbing against my chest and all these different proprioceptive cues that you can use that ultimately turn walking into a meditative experience. And that's the key, is creating this interception, creating this internal experience that allows you start paying attention to your body.

Ben Pakulski: So as I sum up and summarize this brief Q&A, I appreciate your time, guys. And hopefully that provided some value for you, maybe the type of thing you want to go through and listen to again, if you have questions, because I'm sure you will. I would love to hear from you. So please go ahead and contact me on social media. I would love it if you guys left a review. Tell me if you enjoy this podcast, tell me if you want more like this. So this is the type of stuff that I'll cover with my coaches, with my clients, with my mentoring group. Guys like this stuff, unless you can do this stuff, all those other things you're trying to do downstream aren't going to be as useful. They're not going to be as beneficial. You're not going to be able to the lift as heavy run, as fast work, as long without getting in your promise. If you're not willing to put in the 20 minutes a day that it takes to do this breathe, walking and meditate piece, you're just not committed to your goals and if that's you. That's you. That's OK. If you admit that's OK. But at least once you to know that this is the foundation of all human movements, if you're going to do anything for yourself over the next 30 days, commit to a diligent practice and breathe, walk, meditate, you guys can tag me in the hashtag breve walk, meditate or be w m not BMW, but be M hashtag.

Ben Pakulski: If you guys want to do that, you can tag me on that. I'd love to hear from you. And tell me how it works for you. Tell me how it feels to tell any problems you're having. You're having a limitation, something. Tell me about it. So if hey man, you know my feet really hurt, my ankles really hurt or something. Let's see if we can find a solution within this brilliant community. I might not be able to find a solution, but somebody will. We have incredible minds in this community and someone out there is willing to help. And I would love to hear from you. You guys can also join the Muscle Intelligence Facebook community private group. No charge. We've got some incredible human beings contributing in there and always tightening up the reins in that group. So we make sure the information stays very, very high. I'd love to hear about your transformations and how Muscle Intelligence has helped you with this incredible community we're building around humans that just want to live the greatest life and lead with their heart.

Ben Pakulski: All right. I want to live a life that's an adventure that helps humans, that ultimately leaves this place better than I found it. And I really appreciate you guys being part of that mission. So today's podcast is brought to you guys by Blue Blox. Blue Blox are my all time favorite blue blockers and throw on my clear blue blockers now. That works. I don't want the podcast because if you sing in person, you are on video. You can see how the blue reflects off my light, my eyes. And I like for you guys to see my currently tired looking at us. This is my fourth podcast today. But you know I want you guys to see. And I usually will wear them 100 percent of time almost when I'm not on a podcast. But the difference I see if you guys ever watch me on a podcast. You see I'm blinking kind've out of control. And gosh, maybe I've got my eye I must go to. But it seems to only happen when I'm in these fluorescent flickery lights and staring at a blue screen. And I can mitigate that just by throwing on a pair of blue blocking glasses from blue blocks.

Ben Pakulski: And Blue Blox is hooking you guys up, if you head over to Blue Blox dot com and use the code muscle. You're going to get 15 percent off of your blue blocking needs and use my sleep mask almost every night.

Ben Pakulski: Now, it's an absolute game changer. My room is relatively dark anyways, but I find that maybe it's just the pressure against my eyes tends to help me wake up feeling absolutely refreshed and rejuvenated. So thank you to Blue Blox for making this podcast happen, and I'd love to hear from you guys.

Ben Pakulski: So thank you for your time. I appreciate you being here. I appreciate you giving us your time. And Ashleigh and I are both grateful for you and your time and for contributing to this mission of all of us living our greatest life in a body we love. Keep lifting each other up, help each other and let's all thrive.

Ben Pakulski: Now and forever.
