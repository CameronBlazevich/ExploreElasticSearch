Q&A2-How to get out of the victim mindset

Ben Pakulski: Welcome back, ladies and gents, the muscle intelligence podcast Q&A edition with Ashley VanHouten. Ash, What's going down?

Ashleigh VanHouten: Not much. I'm happy the sun is shining. I have lots of questions to ask you. I'm I'm excited to get going today.

Ben Pakulski: We're starting a new format this week, right? We're going to release the Q and A's on Monday this week rather than Thursdays.

Ben Pakulski: We're going to do that ongoing because we want to make sure that everybody is starting the week. Right. We're going to be giving you guys habits of the week for you to lock in your greatest life and begin workout tips. You giving brain optimization, body optimization and really everything we can do to start you guys off on an amazing journey this week and every week from here on out. So super pumped about that.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah, I love it. I love the idea that we can kind of all come together around like hashtag Monday motivation. There's a reason why that exists, right? Like people want to have something to focus on and and work towards and having just like a format for like positivity and learning and progression every Monday.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I love this idea.

Ben Pakulski: As I'm building on my coaching platform, which is getting ready to relaunch.

Ben Pakulski: One of the things that I built in and I thought it was so important is this idea of habit stacking. And, you know, many people are sometimes overwhelmed and burdened in their life with whatever success means. Like, I'm having a hard time making forward progress. I'm having a hard time becoming the person I want to become or creating life of what live. And it's important to realize that it's not a destination or it's a journey. So introducing a weekly habit or a daily habit or whatever, it is something that will slowly and incrementally stack on your previous shelf and keep making you better and better and better. Better. That's how you change your life, right? It's the ascension of the mountain. It's not just taking a helicopter ride to the top. And that's kind of what this is about. So, you know, I created a 30 day habit dock that I'll be giving away to everybody who wants it. So little one habit a day for three days. You could choose a juice however you like. Right. I just happened to put 30 in a calendar so you guys can try something new every day or do one week. Right. I really believe it takes time for these habits to stick, especially the harder ones.

Ben Pakulski: So you do one every 30 days, do one every every seven days, whatever happens to work for you. But you got to lock it in and make sure it's a high impact habit for you. And one thing, you also use some simple ones that I've done and love to hear is as well, like this simple act of drinking one liter of water as soon as I wake up. This simple act of flossing my teeth as soon as I wake up right now, usually flossing teeth comes first. These are habits that have stuck. And then, you know, after the both of those happen, then it's the 10 minutes of meditation, then it's the 10 minutes of breathing. Then it's the 30 to 60 minutes of walking. And I'm stacking those things right. It's not like I'm doing five habits at once. I'm making one unconscious to where I feel like I just do without thinking about it. And then I build on top of that. And I think that's such an important lesson for people to learn is, hey, like it can change the world to one day, but you can certainly take one step in the right direction. What are your favorite daily habits? They're kind of non-negotiable. You have any of those?

Ashleigh VanHouten: Okay. So I have a 30 day habit calendar, too. And each day is eat a different animal part. And it's very unpopular.

Ashleigh VanHouten: No, I love, but I do love. And I just want to eat before I get into mine.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I do want to just like reiterate what you're saying about the stacking habits, because I think that's so important. And one of the things that another very smart coach and Canadian whom you have interviewed recently, James Fitzgerald, will put that in the show, notes people can go back and listen to it, because that was one of the most exciting, excited I ever was to listen to one of your interviews, because I just think both of you are amazing and have so much to offer. But one of the things he speaks to a lot in his coaching is very similar to this. It's the stacking habit. So if he were if he's working with a client and it's just about like nutrition or fixing body composition or something, he might work with a client for a month on like just getting rid of processed carbs at breakfast. And people can, like go nutso, right. 'Cause they're like, this isn't enough. Like, how is this going to change my life? Like, you should be giving me a whole different food plan. You should give me all these workouts. It's like that's not how people make lasting change. It's not going zero to 100. You have to do what you're saying is just kind of do it until it's a behavior, until it comes second nature. And it's not something you have to think about or work towards anymore. And then you stack another one and then you sack another one. And then a year later, look at the change you've made. And I think people need to like really internalize that a bit more. It's very important.

Ben Pakulski: Totally. And that's one of the arguments I always have. Nutrition is sort of every nutrition issue. Or even maybe it's a retreat to asks as well how to get somebody in shape when you got to put them on the deficit and you gotta increase their output. I think that's absolute nonsense because it's not a sustainable change. You need to change one small thing that will make the biggest difference in the life.

Ben Pakulski: And for most people, it's not their diet, it's not even their training. It's usually they're stressed. Right. The stress is contributing to inflammation, to cravings, to high levels of cortisol, to supports the poor energy. All these things are directly correlate with high level stress. So why are we going after somebody, nutrition, putting them in a deficit and giving them more calories when both of us are.

Ben Pakulski: More exercise, both of those things are just contributing to more stress makes absolutely no sense to me, but the habit this week that I think is probably the most impactful one that anyone could do is remove victim words.

Ben Pakulski: So there's there's five words that identify phrases that I identify as victim words. And I think everyone should get rid of these things.

Ben Pakulski: And this is gonna be the habit of this week. And I one ever does just pay attention to and use these five victim phrases.

Ben Pakulski: And those are need to have to impossible try and can't.

Ben Pakulski: And those are the ones that are removed from my children's life. And I always call them on it. And it's just nonsense.

Ben Pakulski: I'm afraid those need to have to impossible try and can't.

Ben Pakulski: And all of those should be removed from our life and started to pay attention to the words that we use so powerful.

Ben Pakulski: And I love having people in my life who call me on my B.S. words, write the words I use that are just taking away my power right in life. You're either a victim or you're an owner, right? You're powerful or you're a victim. And if you're using victim words all the time and taking away your power and giving away your power, you just can't succeed. You're not going to be happy. You're not fulfilled. I think that maybe the most important, powerful habit everyone should stick to this week and check in with us next week and let us know. It went like one week, seven days. Commit yourself. You know, if it's writing on your hand, if it's putting an elastic band around your wrist. If it's having Ashley yell at you in your phone every day, favor it. We should actually say we should record this for social media. We should make it a gif.

Ben Pakulski: It should be like, you know 

Ashleigh VanHouten: Me just berating you for using victim words.

Ben Pakulski: I think you should.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Love it. Well, I think but I do think, like you said, just to to add a little bit of accountability here, like for for people who are following along and are trying to do some of these things with us to like tag you on social media. So tag at muscle intelligence podcast, tag AP, pack fitness and let us know that you're doing it so that we can share it so we can communicate with you guys because otherwise we're just speaking into a vacuum. But if you tell us that you're listening and you're trying, then we can do more and work harder and give you more information. But we need to know that people are responding to this stuff. So that's important. But can I. Can I just have like a proud B PAC mentorship moment right now with you? Sure. OK. This just shows how in sync we are. This is why these weekly calls are like the best therapy I could ever have. This morning I posted on social media about how and it literally is the exact same phrasing I was talking about like gratitude and not complaining about working out even when it's hard because I said we don't have to work out. We get to workout and we should be grateful that our bodies can move and that we can do that. And we have the time and that ability to go to the gym and work hard and do things that are challenging. That's like one of the best gifts we can give ourselves in life. We don't have to workout. Stop saying you have to. You don't have to. You get to. And that's amazing. And we're so lucky. I posted that this morning. And now we're having this conversation. It just it makes me really happy. I feel like I'm I'm on the right trajectory. Right. We're in sync. Absolutely. It makes me so happy. All right. OK. And that's that's for everything, right?

Ben Pakulski: Since for everything in life. Right. It's it's working out. It's food. It's family is it's really anything you can learn to just switch that perspective and be grateful.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I love it. And then another thing that I wanted to mention, because this is something we talked about off line, but part of this whole sort of exciting new movement that we're working on here with this is that along with the Monday Q&A, you're also putting out a newsletter and it's gonna be weekly. And that's also going to be coming out sort of in conjunction with all of us, too. So it's going to have a lot of additional resources and information and kind of they're all going to feed into each other. Right. So people should start watching out for that.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah. So, I mean, I've got so many cool things happening and so many people ask us to keep updated and they want to learn. They want to understand how to upgrade their body and mind and every aspect of life. So one weekly newsletter going out likely on Fridays to summarize all of the amazing things that are going on the week, the things that we're reading, the things that we're excited about, things that we're learning, and maybe just a tip to help, you know, go to your body or build your mind or overcome stress or optimize sleep or anything really that comes around this overarching belief, too, that what we can and should be able to optimize our life and people can go on muscle intelligence, WSJ.com, to sign up to subscribe to the newsletter, right?

Ben Pakulski: Yeah. So if you got a MuscleIntelligence.com, there's going to be a place to put your your email for the newsletter.

Ben Pakulski: Specifically, if you want to get the 30 day habit calendar, you can go to Muslim tells dot com slash podcast and it's there. There's also the 44s Just Principles, which is our most popular podcast to date yet, which is the one I did right after New Year's by myself talking about my 44s success principles and get that in a document there as well. And if you guys drop or e-mail in there, we probably won't spammy or sell your email like that. Give you the regular weekly emails.

Ashleigh VanHouten: It's just free information and it's just another way to kind of reach out and connect, and I have to say, like, I'm happy that you're doing this. And I think it's something that a lot of people are gonna get a lot out of an eye and a much smaller platform like I have a weekly newsletter to. And it's been one of the most sort of fun and rewarding parts of the work that I do, because for somebody who loves to communicate and share stuff with people and have people interact with you like it just it's just another way for me to talk to people and gotten a lot of value out of it. I hope that the people who are getting the newsletter to get a lot of value out of it, I think they do. But I really appreciate that you're kind of willing to take that extra step for people.

Ben Pakulski: So what we'll do with your ashes will link to yours through mine. So if anyone who signs in through the most intelligent one will be able to link through yours at the bottom of the email, will make sure yours is linked in every week so people can connect with you as well.

Ashleigh VanHouten: So it's basically the same just a little bit less meditation, a little bit more beef liver, really all the same thing. All right, sweet. OK.

Ashleigh VanHouten: So I have some questions I want to ask you now that actually kind of relate to some of this like habit stacking thing. And the first one is sort of a selfish question, because you mentioned this a little bit about the like one of the easy, I guess, quote unquote, easy sort of steps you could take is just like drinking water first thing. And drinking water is like the hardest. I have overcome so many bad habits and built so many good ones. And I still cannot drink enough water in the day. Like what is wrong with me? That's my question. Ben, what's wrong with me?

Ben Pakulski: Honestly, it's just a habit like anything, right? It's really hard to get used to putting more water in your belly than you want to. And now here's the thing. Right. Like I noticed this habit being extremely beneficial for performance. But as I've told you, I think in recent days, there's people out there who are telling you not to drink water because deuterium is actually potentially way too negative for your health. So if you're not drinking a lot or I would would stress about it, but where it starts to become an issue is if you're an athlete or if you're performing, if you're creating a tremendous amount of oxidative stress in your body, then I believe you need a lot more water to kind of begin to flush these things out. The idea of improving your ability to excrete. Right. You basically have three mechanisms of excretion. You have sweat and urine and stool. And anytime you're trying to anytime you're burdening your body with a high amount of whether it be stress or toxins or inflammation and like the you need to increase your your excretion. Right. The amount of excretion has to hopefully exceed the intake of toxins. So in consuming a high amount of toxins, whether it be through diet or through air or increase or increasing the amount of oxidative stress in your body from exercise, well, then we need to increase our bodies both excrete. So it's sweating, getting in the sauna. It's being sure we're creating the waters or urinating is you're creating fiber potentially through duggleby vegetables or a supplement to increase excretion through stool.

Ashleigh VanHouten: All right. All right. I got to work on it because I feel like I'm good. As gross is this sentence is.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I feel like I'm good at excreting about taking it and it. And so I like I've got my own sauna. I love to sweat.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I love to run around and get all of all the toxins out. But it's getting the water in so that that process happens more smoothly, that I have a harder time because I just I'm like, I'd rather drink coffee, you know, I'd rather drink like sparkling water. I know that's not ideal, but I got a her. Right. Well, I'm going to add that to my calendar, my personal.

Ben Pakulski: Oh, that's why I do it in batches. Right. So I'll do a leader to leader and have as soon as I wake up when you're hungry. Most people are like, oh, I don't want to eat food or, you know, maybe you're really hungry. Well, that's a good time to have it because your belly is empty. And also do a liter and a half. Sometimes the two leaders during my workout, because that's another time we're like water is extremely important. So I usually have five hundred mils before a train and then ordered and saw a leader and a half to two meters during a workout. Because you're increasing so much usted stress and water itself is the best way to get a pump right. If you don't have enough water issue with some sodium in there as well. But those two times himself is great. And then oftentimes to be honest, I have a lot of water before bed, not because it's a particularly good idea just because it tends to be when I'm hungry and I don't like to eat too late at night. So I have you know, the lead didn't have to. Two tutor's there and I'm kind of good, right. I don't drink a lot of between.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Ok. All right. Speaking of drinking liquid and possible stress to your body, there's a question on social media about your thoughts on coffee and gut health. And I know you've talked a bit before. You're not like a coffee. You like it. You drink it sometimes. But what are your thoughts in terms of like people are always talking about, like the potential benefits, the antioxidants and the performance benefits, but then there's like stress and cortisol raising parts of it, like, what are your thoughts on that in general?

Ben Pakulski: Well, I don't think coffee, as far as I know, has any negative effects on the gut itself. It does have negative effect is increasing sympathetic arousal. So if you're someone who's highly sympathetic. Now, again, I've talked about this a million times, but yet I still hear people saying, hey, Ben, you're using words. I don't know what you're talking about. So sympathetic is the autonomic nervous system. I mean, you have a sympathetic and parasympathetic branch sympathetic thinks stress s stress parasympathetic is resting.

Ben Pakulski: So if you're constantly stimulating your body with more stress, which is very, very typical in our society, you're going to have more of a sympathetic arousal than you to a person, pathetic arousal. And that's correlated with high amounts of cortisol, high amounts. Most get attention in low amounts of oxygen, brain fog and eye inflammation. All these negative things that come with stress.

Ben Pakulski: So if you're someone who's chronic stress to begin with and having more coffee will absolutely start to disrupt digestion. So one thing I didn't allude to there is the sympathetic nervous system is called your fight or flight nervous system and it shuts down digestion. Right. Louis slows stomach emptying so that it can shunt more blood to the limbs for fight or flee. Right. To fight or flee off to fight or run away. So your digestion basically stops when you're at a high amounts of arousal, and that happens oftentimes when there's food in there. These things tend to sit in there for long periods of time. Bacteria can become overgrown and the gut can start to become leaky. So that's the only scenario where I can see coffee contributing in some negative way to good health.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Can I just interject for one second, though, really quick. What about the fact that coffee for most people is basically like it's there's a laxative effect? Right. Like a lot of people like drink coffee in the mornings. They can go out there like morning poop before they go about their day. So how is that not affecting your gut in some way? If it's like pushing stuff through immediately. Not to say that's a bad thing, but like it's it's got to be doing something in there, right?

Ben Pakulski: Yeah, that's just it. Affecting autonomic nervous system again I think. Right. So it's just. Yeah. Just in some way. Again I haven't even thought that through at all.

Ben Pakulski: For the next time we do a podcast. I'll go take a look at how that happens. But for sure like certainly going to increase motility maybe immediately. So you know what happens when people become really stressed? Like if I put a gun to your head, what happens to your or bowel control? So it's a huge amount of syphilitic stress. Your body a little bit, let everything go. So it's kind of a similar response, I think. So there's one more thing where I think coffee can be really negative to gut health. It's one of the most widely sprayed crops in the world. Right. So tons of pesticides and really low quality coffee that's really highly roasted. So, OK. Those two things together are going to cause inflammatory disaster in your GI tract. So make sure the quality of your coffee is good. Sorry. Dunkin Donuts story. Starbucks, you're out.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Esh Yeah. I was going to say you're going to get super mad at me if you ever see me drinking like a McDonald's iced coffee aren't you. I'm just going to throw it out there for talk about any coffee anyway. All right.

Ben Pakulski: So I'm I'm very much a coffee snob, too, where I usually won't drink coffee at less organic. You know, I've had a couple on last couple years that are not organic, but I'm very much a coffee snob. And if you're someone who likes coffee, you do notice a difference when you have really good quality, freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee versus like something that's pre-ground that's been sitting in a box or a bag somewhere for months and months at a time. Like I'd like to have my coffee, you know, within two weeks of roasting and within 50 minutes of grinding. Right. So I always buy beans. I grind them in an all middle grinder. And I'm going to be easily using a chemical or a French press right there. And then the water is not too hot. So you're not over steaming the water. You don't want the water to be too hot because it tends to make the coffee more acidic. So I forget the exact temperature, but it's certain the under the boiling point. And that's just cool. Produce the best coffee. And literally the GI effects from that are so much less. Like you're not going to poop your pants, you're not going after into the toilet from really good quality organic coffee prepared the right way. We should do it. We should all podcast just on how to prepare coffee and prepare stuff.

Ashleigh VanHouten: That would be really good. We should do that. We'll do that one in person because I think that would be a fun one to watch. Chase Yeah.

Ben Pakulski: So I've got a really brilliant roaster, Lily a block from where I am. And they do such great coffee sometimes they invite me over. Fourth called the cupping and they'll bring in new beans and roast 'em in different ways and black. Try these and see which one do you like and you like the dark roast to the light roast. And it's really fun to go and explore your palate with these different types of coffee and see which one you'll end on. And that's fun.

Ashleigh VanHouten: That is a very cool idea. And that's I mean, that's why I like cold brew because it's slower. Yeah. I know. Say yes, lower acidity, but it's also higher caffeine, which is not what I want. But I know, I know it's just for taste. But I guess it's also probably better for you in the long run. I think it's a good bar to set to like have coffee that doesn't make you poop your pants. I think that's a that's a good starting point.

Ben Pakulski: For one more thing I would add about coffee is I've had a ton of people message me lately about intelligent coffee and what it is.

Ben Pakulski: And it's just this coffee concoction that I've put together, which is collagen powder, AMCC powder, Lion's Mane and Alpha T.P.S.. So for primary ingredients and I put those into my coffee to blend it. It's the most wonderful way to start your morning. Now here's the catch. After traveling as much as I had, I felt like I was spoiled. Here's why. I've typically always used NCT powder from kind of whomever. Right? I'd go and buy. You from this company, that company, and never really had to tell us what tour was coming from. You know, sometimes I use Dave aspeech brain octane, and that's great, except I find that putting an oil into it, into a coffee is very different. So very different appearance for the coffee ends up being oily, whereas you put a powder in it, some sick, more of a creamy experience. So I started switching to cream and then I had a company who mentioned the second send me a bag and individual packets of this city or city powder and those like Ogress kind of assumed it was like. But he also used it. And, you know, I think I had maybe fifteen individual packages and then I ran out and went to the store and bought a new one.

Ben Pakulski: And those exact same ingredients, literally verbatim. It's sodium city C-8 oil plated on the case of fiber. So they have to have a fiber that attaches to it to make it solid rather than liquid. Both the exact ingredients on label and there was a completely different product. I have no idea why, but the product that I'm using that I think is amazing is Bubbs. And you know what, Bubbs, in the past and as of right now, I have no relationship with Bush. Right. We have we've extended the olive leaf for, you know, said hello and credit, maybe a conversation, but no paid endorsement from Bubbs at all. Just a really, really great quality product. And after speaking with him a few weeks back. Well, these are great people, too. So anyone out there who actually enjoys morning coffee and does put NCT in it. Go to Bubbs, Bubbs Naturals dot com and all the code for your stuff like that. But go there by boat. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. And that made the biggest difference in my NCT intelligence coffee experience.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Love it. You have to put that recipe in upcoming newsletter as well as people to ask you about that one a lot. And yeah, Bubbs, they're fantastic. I've been a huge fan of their company for years. I discovered them, I think through maybe paleo facts or something. I ended up writing a great story about them. Maybe we'll post that in your newsletter at some point. But there are really transparent, really sincere company that they started from a philanthropic angle. And then basically it was almost like a follow up like, oh, I guess we should offer a product too. And they did that instead of like, let's create a product and then just say we're giving some money away to charities that people will like us, like they really want kind of the other way, which is really quite unique. But there are really legit companies, so I'm glad that you're enjoying their products. I crushed their college. I'm not so big on the m.c team, but I used their college and everything.

Ben Pakulski: So why aren't you big on MCT?

Ashleigh VanHouten: I think I always felt like I guess I didn't really need it. I haven't really felt like I need it for the reasons that people normally take MCT. Like I have a bunch of it. I have a bunch of bubbs in my supplement drawer and it's there if I need it. But I guess I just never really I don't know. I guess I hadn't really experimented with it and felt like I needed it when I have tried it. I haven't felt like, oh, I'm suddenly a superhuman now I'm sick. I don't know. I feel like I'm getting what I need for my diet.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah, for sure. I mean, certainly brain fuel for me. But it's also a better Koff experience than having to add milk or cream or almond milk.

Ben Pakulski: That's kind of the best substitute for most people out there.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah, that's a fair point. Maybe I'll start trying MCT instead of cream, but I do like the cream in my coffee, so maybe I'll add that to my 30 30 day calendar to like get rid of the cream try's and MCT. See what happens.

Ben Pakulski: I'll make you a coffee. You'll, never go back.

Ashleigh VanHouten: All right. So I have one kind of bigger question that I want to get into, and this might take the rest of this this Q&A today. But it was a question that was posed on social media and it was done really thoughtfully. And I think that it's something that a lot of people struggle with. And so I wanted to pose this question to you and we'll see what kind of conversation comes out of it. But it's from an individual who is feeling very frustrated because they're are trying their best to improve their life. And a lot of the ways that you talk about on the podcast and other channels about ways to learn and habit, build and just educate yourself to be the best version of you that you can be. Right. And I think that a lot of us are people who are listening. They're listening for that reason. And we're all here on earth to try to just improve ourselves and be the best, happiest, healthiest versions of of who we can be. Right. But this person was frustrated because they found that some of the people in their immediate group and this could be family and this could also be friends.

Ashleigh VanHouten: We're not in the same place, which is OK. But in some ways, it was sort of actively dragging them down or maybe frustrating them or maybe upsetting them. And I guess the question was, was sort of twofold. It was like, how do I help the people that I care about, even if they're not really in a place to be helped? And then the second part of that question is, how do I not let those people bring me down when I'm not in a situation where I can just, like, get them out of my life? Right. Like, if this is family that you love and you care about, they're going to be in your life. And maybe for whatever reason, they're discouraging of you or they're complainers or they use this victim language that you talked about and they're really bringing you down. How do you navigate that? Well, you can't just be like, all right, mom. Well, you're out of my life forever.

Ashleigh VanHouten: What do you do?

Ben Pakulski: Again, I'll offer perspective on this because I've gone through it. Going through it and I think forever. There will always be some level of pwning going on in life, and one way to offer perspective was as a man or a woman. It was a man on this quest in this. So here's perspective. Typical life expectancy of a man in this day and age is 78 years old.

Ben Pakulski: So subtract your current age from 78 years old, son, 38, minus 70. Let's say you've got 40 years left to live and you multiply that by 365 days. How many days is that? Just over twelve thousand days. I've got 12000 days left to live. I don't want to waste one of those days on somebody who is in any way restricting me from optimizing and living that day to its fullest. And no, I understand that sometimes that's your family. I understand that sometimes people that are close to you, but you can not let people bring you down. You have to live your life. Do not be fearful of what they say, of what they do. Their words are not a reflection of you, the reflection of them.

Ben Pakulski: So do not ever let them hold you back.

Ben Pakulski: And if they have to leave, if they if they choose to not support, then it's OK. And when they see you living your good life, they will either come along or they won't. And that's OK, too. You can't be left held down by these people. It's just a terrible, terrible place to live. And now I also suggest don't try to help them. Don't try to change them. As much as that's not intuitive for me to say that you can't help somebody who doesn't want to be helped. What you suggest what I suggest you do is you ask. Would you like some help with that? Asking for their permission to help is an absolutely necessary part of gaining the their permission and them saying yes. And them actually acknowledging that they want your help. Therefore, they may be receptive to taking it. I do that coaching. Oh. Would you like some coaching on that or would you like some guidance? And that stuff is so important getting there agreeance in there. Yes. I'd like your help with this is the only way to get somebody to buy into what you're saying, what you're doing. So I get it. I'm going through some stuff and I've gone through some stuff for the last three years where you just have to prune away these people, you know? For me, it started at twenty seven years old and I made a decision that it wasn't good to talk to certain people. And it sucks at first is going to be paying for it. There's going to be discomfort because you're going it's out of your comfort zone. But there's so much beauty in life. On the other side of that pain, and most people are too afraid to go through that pain to experience the beauty on the other side. But hopefully you can be strong enough and just remove it. And if it happens to be your spouse, all you can do is work diligently to be your best self. And if they won't come along for the ride, you can not take their head and insist.

Ben Pakulski: You just have to say when you're ready. I'm here and I'd love to help you. And that's it. And as they see you thriving, hopefully they see they come along. And to be honest, I've got some people very close to me who just don't want to change. They just have no desire right now. And you can't do anything about it.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. I mean, like you said, it's changing even when it's for the better. I can be scarier than staying in the misery that you're used to. And everybody knows that everybody has somebody in their life that prefers to be a victim or a martyr, because as unpleasant as it is, it's something that they're familiar with and they're comfortable with. And I think the only thing that I would add to what you said, because it was really well said, is that the frustration that you feel and the upset and the hurt that you feel when there's someone that you love who doesn't want to get better. One of the things you have to do, in addition to not trying to kill yourself, to change somebody who doesn't want to change is spend some internal some self-reflection time trying to understand why you feel the way you feel about that situation. So like, for example, I have somebody in my life that has spent a lot of time in a sort of victim role and just always want to be negative and always want to complain. And every time I got on the phone with this person, I had to steel myself knowing that was just gonna be this onslaught of like negativity and unhappiness and all this stuff.

Ashleigh VanHouten: And I'd feel this frustration and like my heart. I just wanted to fix them and shake them and say, just snap out of it. Like, Stop being such an asshole. Like, just beep. You can do. You can change your life. And instead, what I had to do and this took a really long time to get there is I had to like sit with myself and think about if this person never changes. How do I become okay with that? Like, am I going to let that ruin my life every time I talk to this person or think about this person like there's some work that I have to do to be okay with the fact that I can't fix everybody or I can't help everybody. You know, so always kind of look back internally and how you can have you. You can only do what you can do and only react yourself to like what's happening outside. So I think just kind of doing a little bit of introspection instead of like that, wanting to push out and fix like think about internally what you can do to change how you feel about the situation, too.

Ben Pakulski: That's beautiful. So important. And you're absolutely right about the. You have your beliefs and expectations around what a great life is or what life should be. May not be the same as they are straight. They may not have the same worldview as you. They may not have the same aspirations as you, the man, and have the same beliefs, period. Or the same values. Maybe you value very different things. So how can you say that? Hey, you need to come along from this ride with me and this is where I want to go and this is where you should come to it. This just doesn't make sense. So if your values don't line up in your beliefs, don't line up, well, there's a strong likelihood that this person is not going to be in your life for long. And if you are attached to having them in your life or you're going to experience pain because you're not going to live out your true essence. Right. So it's so important to become comfortable with your values and your beliefs and live into that. Like this is what my dream life looks like and this is what I need to create for me. If you're not willing to come along on that. Right, that's OK. Like, I'm not going to be angry with you. I'm going to wish you love. I'm going to wish you happiness. But I'm going to be over here finding my bliss, because as a human being, you're just here to to help the world become a better place and to find what makes you totally fulfilled so that you can help other people find their happiness and fulfillment. Right. That's ultimately I think that's what it's about. And if someone's not willing to or are not going to the same place you are, it's not a bad thing. It's not a problem. It's just the reality. So don't judge it and let them move on just like you do.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah, we don't all want to go to the same place because it would get crowded there. So it's good that there's different places that people want to go. Right. Like you said, Darby, and it is painful. Like there's no one said that this was easy and navigating relationships and navigating, getting very clear about what you want in life and then going after it. That's not easy at all. And actually in a lot of cases involves a lot of pain and extricating yourself from situations that it's really, really painful and tough. But that's what life is. Life isn't just a series of easy, breezy events or else be pretty boring.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah, I think this is a great time to point to a post I made this week on social media on Instagram, and it's literally just a repost I made from Mr. Rogers. Fred Rogers. And it's funny because I never, never grew up watching this guy.

Ben Pakulski: And no, it really was. But watching these videos that this go so was beyond his time and the video. To paraphrase but basically this idea that it seems as though we're all aggressively pursuing intelligence and wisdom and knowledge at the avoidance perhaps of stillness and silence. And most people and I'm very guilty of this at times neglecting the necessity of stillness and silence in learning to understand. You might learn to understand your essence. And this is why this is a good Segway. It's like if you want to understand what your bliss is, where your happiness lies. The key lies within stillness and silence and being alone. I highly suggest that every human being take at least 30 minutes, ideally 60 minutes every single day to be by yourself and be silent.

Ben Pakulski: No phone, no podcast, no books, no TV. Be by yourself and allow your brain to go where it wants to go. And at first it may be painful. At first it's going to get a monkey mind or squirrel brain. Right. But eventually you'll get to the point where you'll start to uncover these these realizations and awareness is around who you are, what you want. What makes you happy? What doesn't make you happy. Because with that silence, you'll see your fears, you'll see your anxieties, and you go. That's something I need to get rid of. That's something I need to deal with. And most start coming to the surface. And eventually, once you've dealt with all those fears and anxieties and inadequacies, on the other side of those is where your bliss and your joy and your fulfillment lies, right. So face those fears, faces anxieties that come up in silence, cause without facing them, they will never go away. It's like sweeping them under the carpet. Right. Just Jordan, Peterson says, sweep these little things under the carpet. Eventually, they're not so little. And that's important.

Ashleigh VanHouten: So grateful for these conversations. Banned seriously. As you're talking, I swear, my like Rabbitt heart is just like it's calm. And as you're talking, I'm like, Uh-Huh, everything's gonna be okay. Okay. I feel better about things that makes me so happy. I'm so I'm so glad we get to have these conversations every week. Likewise. Thank you. Have you seen the the recent documentary about Mr. Rogers? I think it came out like last year.

Ben Pakulski: I have not um, but I will.

Ashleigh VanHouten: You don't watch a lot of TV. I don't know why you'd want to watch. I actually saw it in theaters. There's like this little one of those. What do they call like the theaters that only plays like independent films. And I went and watched this. And it's just it's it's incredible. Like the guy is really unique, singular human being, as you alluded to. And I think it's one you you'd want to check out. You should put that on your list.

Ben Pakulski: I definitely will. I mean, it's really hard what you just said there to be a unique, single, singular human being to use your term, like to be someone who stands alone, completely happy and fulfilled with who I am.

Ben Pakulski: What a powerful. Thing. What a scary thing, isn't it like I'm going to be alone and be by myself and I'm not sure if anyone's going to think the same way I do, and I'm not sure if anyone's going to care about me and love me and accept me for who I am. I really need to be absolutely thrilled and I'm going to give other people permission to do the same. Was it scary place potentially to be? But I bet it's so fulfilling when you finally find it fun. There are people who will love you and accept you for that.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Isn't it funny, though, how we all sort of have that fear and we feel alone in that fear when every one literally has that same fear? Like if I was really, truly myself. Would anybody still like me? Like, would I be OK? Would would I still have friends and people who love me like we all think that. And we feel so alone in it, even though we're all in the same place again, the same thing. It's crazy.

Ben Pakulski: I think it's born into our nature, right? As you have to be accepted into the tribe, otherwise you would die. So I think it's born into our unconscious minds.

Ashleigh VanHouten: It's intense. OK. Well, luckily, we've got the muscle intelligence tribe that we're all kind of at least in general terms, we're sort of all on the same trajectory in terms of what we're trying to learn and do and and get better out within ourselves. So we've got this community right. And people can can say what they think and what they feel. And we can talk about it. Maybe you and I would make fun of each other a little bit, but it's always lighthearted.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Generally online, right?

Ben Pakulski: Yes, of course. I mean, silly, of course.

Ben Pakulski: It's so amazing to be able to travel the world now and meet people who are on a parallel path. US. These people who actually are great human beings, who are on this path to loving their life and accepting themselves and giving love and being just wonderful contributors to society, I think is, gosh, it's amazing. And with this underlying tone of, yes, I'm so gonna be strong. Yes. I'm still going to be healthy, but I'm also going to be a great person. I think that is such an awesome thing that I get to know. I'm so blessed to get to experience people around the world. And after London, the health organization of the Manchester and Iceland, there's a lot more coming in 2020. We just announced a number of camps with the Good Life Fitness Company in Canada, which has been doing custom custom camps for in Canada. And I've already got like a huge number of people asking if I'm going to do them other places that aren't for good life. And the answer is yes, that the schedule will be out soon. And I guess we'll be announcing that through the the weekly newsletter as well. The email newsletter.

Ashleigh VanHouten: We gotta shout out, good life for like really being smart and picking some awesome people to collaborate with. Like you think of good life as being just sort of like Canada's Globo gym, which is fine, like they're everywhere and it's great. Let's think about like the last year. They've got Jordan shallow. They've got you like people going to start getting like super jacked a good life and everyone's gonna be like, what's going on? And it's because you guys are in step with them now.

Ben Pakulski: I love the fact that they're stepping up. Right. Like they're trying to separate themselves because there is a ton of noise that. There's a ton of companies just like, hey, we're all the big box and real great and everybody's the best trainer.

Ben Pakulski: Okay. But life's actually stepping up and going, hey, we're hiring the best guys in the world, bringing them into teacher coaches, how to understand this stuff. So the stuff I'm teaching, they're actually figuring out isn't even muscle building like I'm teaching everything else. So everyone in this fitness space tends to focus on two things to focus on training, focus on nutrition. Well, what about all those other things that go into building a great physique and that's, you know, stress and sleep and mindset and environment and, yes, some top to liberate talk around training, nutrition, but not even from a perspective of like what I call the axis Neo's. It's just like, hey, what happens in the gym? That's great. That's different. But let's just let's figure out how to optimize every other aspect of really that's contributing to this internal reality that we all have, you know, mind and nervous system and our bodies kind of sensing the environment and so and then obviously telling it to coaches. So there's going to be a lot about the client experience and delivering that for a client, which is a whole different game altogether.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Good job. Good life, OK. And before I let you go here today, I'm very excited because I am going to be coming to Tampa and going to the Mecca for muscle building for the first time ever. Your jam in Tampa. I'm so excited in November and you've got a muscle cap is there. Maybe I shouldn't be mentioning this online if there's no space, but is there still space for that?

Ben Pakulski: I think there's still a couple of spots. November 8th, 9th and 10th. We also don't really do a lot of promotion of it typically because it does slow pretty quickly. But November 9th and 10th, three days going deeper into everything to do with muscle building and a lot of things that happen outside of muscle building. Like I say, it's just kind of cool experience to connect with this tribe of amazing human beings in a better gym and working really, really hard for three days. And Ashleigh is going to be there.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I am so excited. I am going to spam the Internet with videos like I am going to be all over Instagram when I'm at the gym. I'm so excited.

Ben Pakulski: Awesome. Well, you know, it'll be fun. It's certainly fun for me to teach it. And my my team here, the gym is amazing.

Ben Pakulski: So it's usually just a great week, an objective. And it sounds a bit. And taboo, but the objective is like a life changing experience for everybody and I guess a very cliche, but because we keep the group so small, I'm going to get into your life in some way and understand what that one or two things are that will really shift your life or shift your body composition or shift your stress or whatever. I'm going to ask questions and it may be private, it may be the group, but I'm going to dig in and be like, hey, that's your blindspot. Go fix that. And if you fix that, everything else starts to fall into place. And that's really the objective, is keep the group small so we can have one on one interactions as well as giving you an amazing education over three days is going to be a lot of One-On-One interaction. So it's super fun for me.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Awesome. Stay tuned for a future Q&A where Ben highlights all of my newfound blind spots for everyone to see done.

Ben Pakulski: We're doing that for sure. Thank you all by myself, Ashleigh. You can hear that one. One.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Thanks, Ben. This has been awesome.

Ben Pakulski: Thanks, Ash. Appreciate you. Anyone that we want to shout out to today?

Ashleigh VanHouten: Well, you shout it out, Bubbs, which is awesome. And I think that's it. I mean, I think we're good for today. I think that we've given enough love today. It's a lot.

Ben Pakulski: Well, I'd like to shout out the muscle maven because she's beat us and we'll get more positive feedback on you on the podcast than we do getting A maybe B on the podcast.

Ben Pakulski: So now I think what I'll hear I think there's something going on here. I'm not sure Mike Murphy had a job here during a campaign.

Ashleigh VanHouten: But when I'm right, when I get like two more inches to my quads, I think I'm going to try to take over. But I'm working. Oh, give me a few months.

Ben Pakulski: All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate you very much. And look forward to running against you, as always. Everybody have a happy Monday.
