QA4-Why you have to plan for joy

Ben Pakulski: Hey, everybody, welcome to the most intelligent podcast. I've got my great, amazing, wonderful,

Ashleigh VanHouten: Super smart super.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I'll add I'll add to the list.

Ben Pakulski: It's good to have you back. You know, we had some some holidays there and you get to enjoy time in Costa Rica, which I love to hear about. You know, I did I did some time down South America and in North Carolina. Now I've got 20 2010 a jam packed with things that I love to do, which I'm so excited about.

Ben Pakulski: This this epiphany where, you know, it's only two things. You can change life. It's you can changed the things you do or the way you do them. And I'm really going to do change both. Right. And then it really upgrade my choices. The decisions I make have to be intentional and I have to want to do them. And the things that I want to do makes it really, really easy for me to do really, really well. Right. And I think that's one realization that people need to have in life is, you know, don't make commitments that you don't want to keep and don't make. You can't keep this concept of integrity that keeps six bringing up. And maybe that's the theme of my life from now until the day that I die is massive, massive integrity. And again, it's hard, especially when you're busy and the world is pulling your attention in so many different directions. To actually be a person lives with integrity. And that's why that's something that I'm going to attach myself to as much as I possibly can. You know, 12 percent if possible and never make a commitment that I don't want to keep him ever committed, that I can't keep certainly and move heaven and earth to maintain commitments because I'm so hard.

Ben Pakulski: Right. So words not. And I'm doing my best. So I tend to be the type of person who says, you don't want help, everybody. Yes, I can help you. But then it takes away from so many other great things that you're doing. And you see my schedule. It's like I've done this, OK? I got 30 seconds to get to that thing or I'm already 30 seconds late to get to that thing. And it's, you know, I'm really going to do my best to not make so many commitments, to learn to say no to a lot more things. Delegate a lot more. And really just work on my highest and best and contribute to this mission that sometimes has to ultimately kind of be the catalyst to be the carrier of amazing information, positive insights as gratitude and just giving everybody a positive light in sometimes this world that's a bit dark and stormy and that's really what the mission is.

Ashleigh VanHouten: That's a big deal. That's a big mission. I know. I appreciate you saying, too, that you have to work on this yourself and that you are learning to do things like say no, even when you want to say yes to everything, because you want to do everything and you want to help everybody. But one thing that I'd kind of respond back to that is no matter how busy you are or how big your mission is. We all have to learn to prioritize and realize that we can't do everything right. So even if you have every resource in the world and you're the smartest, most organized person in the world, you still can't say yes to everything. It's going to hurt you and the people you're trying to help if you do. So having setting intention and setting priorities and trying to figure out like, what is your thing? What is the thing you want to accomplish and what are the goals that are going to get you there? I mean, that's key. Can't say yes to everything whether you want to or not.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah, I think a book that comes to mind that everyone should read. If this conversation resonates with you is the one thing by Gary Keller. And it's exactly what the title suggests. It's it's not the most complex read. It's literally just learning to focus, learn to say no. And the subtitle is The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results. That's really the truth, right? Is it's so easy to become distracted in this world of so many things seem compelling. Everyone's got some degree of FOMO or, you know, some type of envy. And they want to. They want to keep up with everybody else instead of focusing on what they're focusing on. The reason that comes up is, you know, had a great work out this morning. And the guy I was working with was, you know, this inspiring I guess it's inspiring at many things that I went through it who he is, but just this idea of staying focused. And I kind of started dwelling back on my career and looking at what allowed me to be successful. And the reality is, when I'm 70 years old, I mean, the decision that I was going to compete in Mr. Olympic contest and you know this you know what was for me at the time, a long term vision, long term goal to mission objective. And that's what I trained for. And I started explaining that to him and every workout.

Ben Pakulski: And like, it was like, hey, man, it's not about this workout necessarily. It's not about winning this next show. It's not about winning your pro card. It's not about, you know, anything. It's about this big picture goal that I have is every single thing I'm doing contributing directly to this big picture goal of being on Mr. Lembit stage and really makes decision making so much easier. It makes me work hard, so much easier, puts things into perspective about like, you know, people blowing smoke up your butt constantly. But how great you look or how bad you look at what it looks like today or how I do today, it doesn't matter as long as it's checking all the boxes on a day to day basis that I need to do to make this goal accomplished. Right. So as a professional body builder, I needed to make sure that I had a great workout. I need to make sure that I prepared to have a great workout. My body was in mind was set to make sure I hit on my meals for that day, on my macros to make sure that I slept well. I need to make sure that I breathe and make sure that amounted to giving sure that I walked into to make sure that I did all the things that would contribute directly to that goal.

Ben Pakulski: And if I did that, I could check all those boxes. Then I knew I was doing absolutely everything. To accomplish that goal and not everyone listen, this wants to be a builder. But I think what. No matter what goal you're after, right, this this idea of sitting big picture, long term goals. Right. The vista of the ten year twenty five year plan allows you to cut away from the noise and the nonsense. It's so easy to get distracted by the shiny red object over there. Oh, that looks really nice right now. But if you know that the big mission in 10 years, 20 years, 50 years is like, that's where I want to end up. It's very easy to go. Well, that's not contributing to the mission. So, you know, at times in my career, I got maybe blamed or accused of being ruthless, but that's really what it was was like. Well, if that isn't contributing to this, I wouldn't do it. You know, I'm going to go my friends, you know, party. Well, great. That's not making my Olympic dream come true. So forget it. And I was so myopically focused on that. That it was a blessing to my success. But it was also a curse to many of my relationships and many sacrifices I had to make. And I think anyone who's a high level athlete or a high level business person gets it. There's always going to be things that you have to cut away from your life.

Ben Pakulski: And that's really the only way to succeed is. And it would just be so single mindedly focused on this thing. And that doesn't mean you can't do other things. But you have to realize, is this taking away? You know, it's either a plus one or two minus one. Right. So to me, the moving one step closer or I'm not only not moving one step closer, but I'm also moving ones that back. So really, that's like two spots, spots backward. Right. So is this event or this decision going to be neutral to me, which means I could stay here? Or am I going to move forward or I'm going to move back and it's one of them. And you have to make that decision. So definitely don't want to be taking any steps back. So for people who are trying to lose fat, people are trying to build muscle. Just ask yourself that question. Right. As far as my big picture goal, what I want to do in the long term is this a plus 1 zero or minus one and ideally get as many plus ones as you can on the day you're sending the proverbial mountain, you're moving closer. That's all life is about, is setting those process goals that bring you closer and closer to where you want to be. I had no intention of starting this podcast this way, but I guess it went down a great path.

Ashleigh VanHouten: You always do that. You're like, hey, how was Costa Rica? Wait. Let's talk about massive life goals and how we're gonna achieve them. But but I don't blame you because this is actually a very good Segway into something. We were just talking about off-line about how we want to sort of have a little bit more engagement from people who are listening to the podcast instead of just putting out great information. What you're doing. Having people kind of give some information back. And I think that that this is a really good sort of intro into that conversation. You're always getting messages. I'm getting messages, too, from people who listen to muscle intelligence about the things that they're learning and the things that they've gained from the podcast and the things that there may be changing or implementing in their life. And it's amazing like that. Those kind of messages are incredible. And I hope that you take a moment to sort of appreciate how much of it and how much of an impact. I'm saying I'm not saying you don't appreciate. I'm just saying the impact that you have. But one of the things we're talking about is making sure that, you know, we have people really respond to the actual messages that we're putting out on the Q&A. So like one of the things we were gonna try to do is talking about these changes that you're making in the new year, talking about things that you're learning and you're trying to implement in your own life, having some of the listeners maybe talk about some of the things that they've taken away from the podcast and what they're doing in their life as a result of something they've learned. It doesn't have to be from a Q&A. It can be from any of the guests you've had, but just sort of tagging us and telling us some of the things that they've learned so that we can see it and we can share it because you can't you know, you can't repost every single dime that you get.

Ashleigh VanHouten: It would be a little bit crazy. But doing it this way and having people kind of share and just creating that environment where people are sharing what they're learning and what's meaningful to them, I think is a really cool idea. So maybe we can start that today and have people do that.

Ben Pakulski: I'd love to do that. One things that I'm really working on in my life is to create almost like an ethos, like like a really clear mission and value statement so that everyone who listens to podcasts can really start to understand what we're about. And there's never any ambiguity. I think that's a huge problem in a lot of businesses as having those really clear value statements and the really clear mission that people can either go, yes, one or listen to this. And yes, I wanna learn more about this or I don't. It's it's polarizing. And that's really the objective that I've created for myself. Dispel a lot of time on it. And Columbia when I was kind of disconnected and, you know, sometimes getting those deep esoteric mindsets is not always easy. You really have to be disconnected for a few days before your brain starts. Get clarity on what is my mission. You know, it's so easy to get distracted by the day to day nonsense. And I always say that it's like most people in life are looking three to six inches in front of their face and they never get a chance to see the big picture.

Ben Pakulski: Right. They never get to see the forest for the trees. They're too busy with the thing that's written from their face. And that's what prevents you from making massive progress and making an impact. In order to make an impact. You need to look, step back, stop doing the day-To-Day things for at least a short period of time and look and feel and see what you want to do. Big picture, how you can impact and how well these pieces amazingly fit together and all the opportunities that sit right there in front of you and how to make them all fit and which way you really want to do right. Most people are so busy being busy and busy, you know, checking. On Instagram and busy making enough money to make the built to pay bills, I get it like it's a necessary part of life, but the people who get ahead are the ones that are able and make themselves able to step back and breathe and exist and feel and meditate on what to what lights my soul on fire.

Ben Pakulski: What makes me get up at 4:30 in the morning and fucking love it, right? Look at me. Holy shit, I'm so blessed. You know, you wake. I wake up every day and literally like a cold shower and thing that comes to life. I smile and I see I'm alive. That's how so. But like, I'm alive.

Ben Pakulski: And that discomfort that I feel or that cold lets me know how alive I really am and the deeper I can get into that cold and discomfort as you go, wow, I'm so grateful to be alive and have this body that responds to these stimuli. Right. Because ultimately death is the lack of response to a stimulus or something. Things stop. If your body stops responding, you die. So if I can get a really intense stimulus that my body responds to, I know I'm deeper and deeper and deeper into this aliveness that I feel. That's so beautiful. Right. And that's talking about how we can thrive in twenty twenty is create a morning routine that lets you know your life and that's breathing and appreciating every breath, then doing something that's hard, doing something that anchors your body, you exercise, it can be meditation, it can be cold showers, it can be all of them. All those things are things that let you know that tasch I'm alive and being present in this reality that how life and life is awesome and that's it.

Ben Pakulski: Like, I mean, anchoring yourself to that is a powerful place.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I have a similar gratitude morning experience to you. I just have it like three hours later than you do. But we all got to start somewhere.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I'm not waking up. Nothing. Nothing gets me up at 4:30, but I'm working on it. But I will say it just to close the loop on this and then to invite again people on social media to join in this with us. Maybe I will just kind of talk about something that I've taken away from the podcast since we've started working together. And I've been fortunate enough to be a part of this over the last six months. Something that I've learned from you and from working with you and from listening to the podcast and some of the things that you kind of touch on over and over again is and we were just talking about it. But it's the idea of having intention behind everything you do and that working towards a greater goal. And I think it sounds like common sense when you say it out loud. But so many of us, even type-A, ambitious, hardworking people, we often, like you said, are just kind of doing the thing that's in front of us because we're doing it and it's there. And even if it's productive, even if it's going to the gym every day or it's like reading, reading about a subject that we're interested in or writing or journaling every day. But if we aren't doing it with sort of a mindfulness about the purpose of it and what it's leading to, we could still be wasting our time even if we're doing something good. And I think about it like when I go to the gym and I'll have periods of time where I don't necessarily have any goals.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I don't really have any intention. I'm not really putting a lot of effort or mindfulness into it. And it's not it's maybe I I'll say it's a zero, not a minus one. Right. Because I'm still going to the gym. I'm getting those endorphins and being physically fit and active. But I'm not working towards anything. I'm not getting closer to the things that I want. And I think that one of the things that just being in regular contact with you and being a part of this podcast is it's always kind of bringing my mind back to that. Like when I'm working on any project, when I'm making any new relationships, when I'm doing anything in the gym. What is the purpose of this? What am I doing it for? How is this gonna help me or the people in my community? Just being more mindful and intentional about it is something that I've and it's already moving the needle as far as what I think I'm accomplishing in life, which is a pretty big deal. So anyway. So I appreciate it. That's what I've learned. And I think that if people can kind of share what they've learned on social media and tag us on Instagram and then we can we can share it and maybe pick somebody in and give them a treat for interacting with us.

Ben Pakulski: Thank you for that. I mean, that's awesome. There's something really interesting that you said it merits that's maybe worth acknowledging and maybe just give people perspective on thinking about things that you like doing versus things that are actually beneficial moving the needle that there's sometimes a contrast there. I like like just things that I like doing that times in my life don't necessarily help or maybe are detrimental or take away.

Ben Pakulski: That's a really amazing dynamic that people live right. As sometimes you like being very social and sometimes you like spending some of their friends, sometimes you like being on social media and eating ice cream and whatever. But maybe they're not directly contributing to your goals. And if you could make those two things line up, that's when things really start to take off. Right. Make creating positive habits that really light you up and make you feel great and also contribute to your goal. And that's this idea that I live. You know, every every day is I've been rewarded in my life. I worked 18 hours a day, right. As know I'm doing things that I love, helping people in a way that I love them learning. And I'm so passionate about all of those things and getting to do podcasts with you and with amazing guests. You know, that these people that I'm now calling superheros of body and mind, I think there's so much to be learned there. Wright is trying to create those. Habits that are directly contributing to your mission and your goal. And if it's not like them, it's like don't do it because like with my mentorship clients actually intentionally plan joy, which we've talked about this before. But like so people have a really hard time being happy and have our time feeling joyful or have hearts and taking a break to to stop and smell the roses.

Ben Pakulski: And so we've literally got to the point with some people where I'm like, hey, during this hour, we're gonna plan something that brings you joy. So we make a list. You know, for me, it's like kids or it's, you know, reading a book or meditating or it's going for a walk or it's exercise. And all those things are things that bring me direct joy and happiness. And I plan them now. I don't allow myself to get too caught in the trap of being busy on things that are important, but maybe not necessarily the greatest difference makers in my life. And I intentionally plan joy. And it sounds like planning sex almost, right? You're like. Well, this is important. We have to do this. So I think that's important for people who maybe to latch on to try to make those two things match up with the things that are that you love and the things that contribute to your mission. And if you can't, then you need to make sure that you're at very least planning joy every single day. Ideally, first thing in the morning when it comes to back to the city of morning routine, cause if I start my day in a blissful place, in a place where I know that I have massive ear to ear smile, my face feeling like my soul is full.

Ben Pakulski: Think of how much more I bring to the world. Like I come to the universe would just be like me. I got an S on my chest and I can take anything to throw it to bring it to me. I got this coach put me in it right. Whereas if I wake up in the morning and I'm kind of dreading it and I haven't got my brain focused and things just don't go the same way because people come in you with the same opportunities, they won't come to you for the same answers because you don't come at the world with the same skill set. Right. So this is so important to wake up every day and go. I got this, you know, give me the ball, coach. I can run. And put me in. Whatever it is, I can tackle it. And that doesn't happen by accident. You know, nobody is born with that. You learn that and you build that over building small victories. Right. Little daily micro wins is what builds that confidence.

Ben Pakulski: Then you can wake up every morning with a smiling face and going. Thank you. Thank you. I'm alive. Thank you. I got to wake up this morning and bring that attitude to the world. You will take over your life. You will crush everything. People will give you raises. They'll give you more money. They will pay you just to be in your presence because people want to see rooms. So this stuff, it seems so simple and maybe so vague, but it really is that simple. I mean, the reason you and I get along so well is when we met, I was like, this chick's confident. She speaks well and she knows where she's going in life. And it's like, that's all I needed. Second, I met you. I was like, well, this this great escalates great. And like, it's energy, right? It's like you brought this confidence and this this belief in yourself. And that's the same way with everybody I meet. Like anybody who I hire or anybody work with is like I want. That's all. It's what I want around me all the time. So why would I hire someone who's got a great skill set? But they're an asshole, right? It doesn't make sense. I don't leave your homeless people.

Ben Pakulski: Like no matter how great they are at what they do. Like, I just want nothing to do with that. Right. And that's what people need to understand. Life is just set yourself apart from the crowd by being grateful, by being empowered, by empowering other people. That's what people want. That's how you create relationships and opportunities.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. Being confident, but not an asshole is a superpower. It's ah, it's hard to walk that line sometimes. And I also got to say that I think you're the only person I know who finds waking up at 4:30 and taking a cold shower synonymous with joy. But I guess we all got to find our joy.

Ben Pakulski: How did you find it? Right. So that's the thing. Like they say in the deepest depths of your hardest set, smile like you find the joy in the discomfort.

Ben Pakulski: Right. That's the ultimate. That's the ultimate in life.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Well, I can and I can get behind that like I like speaking of learning skills or doing things that maybe don't necessarily directly relate to your goals, but don't take away from them either is an example. I'll bring it back to our beautiful time in Central and South America. In December, I learned how to surf in Costa Rica. I had never really surfed before and I didn't go in planning to do it. Just the people I was with, they were all surfers and I was like, why the hell not? I'm on this beautiful beach and might as well give it a go. And of course, it's like any new skill, especially one that kind of takes a high degree of technical ability or strength or confidence, like you suck for a long time. You don't know what you're doing and you bail and maybe hurt yourself. And there's like an element of sort of fear and uncertainty there. But I never for a minute let those parts of it stop me. Like, I just think it's fun. Learning something new is fun and sucking at something for a while too is also fine. Like, don't take yourself so seriously. Like everybody starts and doesn't know what they're doing. And if people try to convince you that's not true, they're full of shit. Like everybody starts somewhere. Look, stupid, doesn't know what they're doing and you get so much out of it. You get so, such a sense of accomplishment when you try something completely new and and gain any kind of competence in it. And I had so much more fun than if I had just decided to sit on the beach and kind of watch everybody else do it. So that's one thing I'm proud of, and I think that a lot of people I know that are really successful people share that kind of characteristic that they're no matter how important or big a deal you are, you're always willing to start at the bottom and start from the beginning and learn new things. And that was like one of the highlights of my December.

Ben Pakulski: Good for you. That sounds awesome. You know, speaking to that, I figure it was listen to you recently, but something along those lines where in children they can pretty much determine who's going to be successful people and who won't be in life based on exactly that. Right. Who finds joy in the process and failing and like, oh, I didn't do it right this time. Go again with two girls. Go again, go again. And they can literally correlate who this person is going to go off and do this because they have this psychological attachment to. I didn't do it perfectly this time. I wanted this almost like dopamine, I think was Dr. human-made actually talked about this may or may not have been on the podcast. You know, the psychological addiction almost to, you know, dopamine and dopamine is this seeking neurotransmitter. Right. Like, I see something over there and I want to go get it. I get dopamine when I want to go get it. And most people, unfortunately, we often speak about, as you know, we're bombarded with dopamine without having to seek anything. You know what? If I want to eat, I go to the fridge. If I want to get some relaxation or some stem as I go to the television and there's no more like desire, seek response. Right. It's desire response. Desire response is no more seeking in society. So people are just have this kind of abundance of dopamine and never have to seek it. And therefore, we become almost saturated and have too much dopamine in other doped me receptors maybe become down regulated.

Ben Pakulski: So these kids who created an association in the brain with having to seek things and they achieve reward at the end of this seeking maybe the reward is the seeking. That's the people that succeed. And that's really what we need to do is because, you know, life has been made way too simple for us. There's nothing else that's challenging at life. You have to intentionally create this. I go after things mentality and I get that, you know, this idea of like I seek and destroy or I seek and I acquire. And that's really what's correlated with growth. And so here's a mission that I actually wrote an article or article for a weekend that I sometimes write articles and I don't ever release them. But there's really two things. You know, people talk about motivation. I don't need motivation. Yes, you do. You have you have endless motivation lives inside of you. But it's dependent on two things. And it's dependent on testosterone is dependent on dopamine. And what's the problem in society right now is that everything that's built around low testosterone, a low dopamine, it's intentional that way, right. Is like people's body compositions are shit. So what I was Sellstrom toilet people's activity level is abysmal. So what happens? Testosterone, toilet and so body composition increased estrogen. Testosterone goes the toilet. You're eating too many calories. Your cortisol goes up, your testosterone goes in the toilet. You're stressed.

Ben Pakulski: Blue light. All these things are causing sympathetic arousal. Testosterone hits the tank. So by design, you have no motivation. Now, as far as the other end of the dopamine, well, you have television. You have social media. You know, anything you want food or immediate disposal. You can get dopamine whenever you want it. So now it's just always there. You have this abundance. Now the receptors become non-regulated. So those two pieces that are correlated with motivation, it's built into society that those are going to be shitty. Those are gone. You know, even looking at drinking water and things like glyphosate, destroying your microbiome, which now we know is going to affect inflammation, which we now know is going to affect decreased testosterone that's built into the system, fluoride chloride. All those things are going to decrease testosterone. So how do you overcome it? Right. It's almost like we're set up to not be able to overcome this. I mean, arguably, we are set up to not be able to overcome this because we don't want people who are motivated and driven and ultimately want an outlet want to lash out against the man. Right. When people who are going to be conformist. So if you can become mindful of this stuff and realize testosterone, dopamine or your two best friends, what am I doing right now or are these contributing testosterone and dopamine or is it taking away? And if you're in any way taking away your little sapping yourself of the motivation, you need to get ahead of everything in life.

Ben Pakulski: If anyone wakes up in the morning, it doesn't feel like getting up or they have a hard time getting up or they hit the snooze button or having a hard time with the body composition, not getting motivated, both their goals. You are a victim to the box. You're living inside this box and you need to if this is your objective at life, break free. We've got to break free. And the only way to do it is like, hey, I have to be lean. I have to know. I know my body composition has to be under ten to twelve percent. I know I need to exercise and I need to do some really, really hard every day. I need to eat meat. Like it or not, guys like meat is correlated with testosterone. Right. And to keep my stress down. So therefore, I should probably meditate. I need to have sex. That's important to testosterone, right? I need to have a physical connection. Relationships that's important to testosterone. All of these things are things that are society is literally built against. So how our society is built not right. Nobody touches each other. Nobody goes near each other because it's fear. Like all somebody can get sued for touching it, run away or not even we don't even know our neighbors for fear of God. Who knows what's going to happen, right? Everything. All of those things I just listed are little built in the society working against you.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. And there's also a social. Media and the way our work is set so that we don't actually interact with people or go out anymore, like even in my generate like our generation, we're not really old people.

Ashleigh VanHouten: And I remember when I was young, like young young, you know, like teens, early twenties. And you're like going out and trying to meet people. You'd go to like a bar or like you'd go out somewhere and meet people. And people don't do that anymore. Like, I have friends who are like, oh, I'm trying to date. I don't know, like, which app do I get on? And I don't want to go out anymore. Like my energy. It's ridiculous. Have you heard about this was like I forget what article I was. I think I was some Silicon Valley guys. But if you heard these people who are doing dopamine fasts, did you hear about this? No. That sounds good, don't you? Yeah, I have to find the article. Maybe I'll try and find it in the show notes. But it was like some dudes and I think there was Silicon Valley guys. But kind of speaking to what you were saying, that like we're just constantly just force feeding ourselves dopamine from like eating food and like watching Netflix or whatever it is, social media. And these guys were like purposely doing dopamine fasts where they wouldn't be like they wouldn't have any social media, any screens they like for either fasting or like eating super bland food or whatever. They were like purposely putting themselves into this like ascetic lifestyle where they had no pleasure, basically, so that when they were done, they could feel it again. I thought it was kind of interesting. Interesting idea.

Ben Pakulski: Brilliant. I think, you know, spending a week up in the mountains like same ideas. You're so disconnected.

Ben Pakulski: Like you don't realize how messed up day-To-Day life is until you disconnect and have no cell phone reception and no ultimate connection to the world without having to actually go 30 minutes in either direction. It's so interesting. And I think that week alone recharge my batteries. You know, there's certainly times when I feel like I'm burning the candle at both ends, but I love what I do, so I never feel like I'm working. But it's just like shooting almost deep enough no matter really, really well. Reading enough I'm not exercising has meant that many times because I'd like to have this goal. This goal this goal is always like, well, when that's done, then I'll do this. But guess what? Those goals keep stacking on top of each other. And I'm very much a goal achiever, which it's like, hey, this is a blessing and a curse again. It's like when you set a goal, nothing stands in my way to do it. But then again, sometimes people, other people stand in your way of doing as far as like not meeting their end of the bargain. Right. And then you end up doing twice as much work and taking the road else's. You take away the world shoulder and suddenly, oh, shit, I didn't do all the things that I need to recharge my batteries. But this idea of a dopamine first. I'm very curious where you hear that, Ashley. Oh, maybe I'll look it up. And if you have some insight.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah, I'll I'll find it because it was it was like a few weeks ago. But I remember thinking actually it's funny cause it was over the holidays. I'm like, oh yeah, Ben's gonna want to hear about this one. Like I should have it, but I'll I'll find it. I'll find it because it definitely exists out there. And I mean, again, things are always sort of you hear about the most extreme examples like most people probably aren't going to take it to the steps that these guys did. But just again, the consideration of like it's the same thing as people who do like no booze in January or no sugar or whatever. I mean, I know that's just one thing, but it's about getting rid of the stuff that is just making us sort of numb and so that we can enjoy it again. Like I've had many conversations with my girlfriends and I'm not like a nutrition coach. I'm just somebody who knows a fair bit and has common sense. I have so many of my girlfriends who literally they don't lift. So they're not like me, like eating twice their weight in protein every day. But they're like, I can't seem to lose this weight.

Ashleigh VanHouten: And I just have this belly and I'm soft and I don't know what to do. And I hardly eat anything. And I'm like, okay, well, that's your first problem. Your second problem is that you drink wine every single night. It's a cultural thing. You do it to relax and to unwind and like all the stuff and you don't even enjoy it anymore. Like a glass of wine. Delicious glass of wine with a steak on Friday night is supposed to be like amazing sensory pleasure. It's not supposed to be something you do every single night to get through your day. Right. So the idea of getting rid of it. I know it's difficult. And like we all know that addiction or whatever our vices or crushes are, it's not easy to just get rid of it. But that's the point. That's the whole point of it. So get rid of that shit and then maybe bring it back in and try to figure out how to incorporate it in your life so that it's a positive special treat that you really, really pay attention to instead of just this thing that's there all the time.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah. And the unfortunate reality is that we all have excuses about why it's OK. Right. And especially as like phones like I actually found myself doing this last week and I was like, oh, better stop doing that. Never do it again because I work on my phone. Like if I myself said the emails, I said myself, you know, doing whatever writing sometimes take notes, orchestrating things that need to happen for my business. I find myself using my phone when it shouldn't be like with my kids also. You know, I just finished on my phone and all this. You are doing all they know. I'm on Instagram screwing your. So I'm thinking about. I need to stop that. You know, I'd like we've created this association, this attachment to I need to do this. I have this this piece here. So I'm actually going to set this goals and not work on my phone anymore, but just to work from my computer so that they see who doesn't appear. That's work. He's not playing on the phone because they think phone.

Ben Pakulski: They think Instagram video games, right? Yeah. So like, it doesn't matter what the reality is, what matters is what they perceive. And that's so, so important to me that my kids know that they're the greatest purdie. And actually, this aligns perfectly with one of the guests we have coming up. And is Dr. Tina Bryson coming on to talk? About parenting and disconnecting and I get exactly what the title of most recent book is, but talk to Dan SIEGEL, just this idea of showing up as a parent. Right. It's like being there, being present, not being on your phone and being in a hole, realizing that your kid looks at you and they go, oh, my, my parent is now choosing this piece of technology over me. This is more important in the scope of the life of a child.

Ben Pakulski: Their world view is very, very small. Their world exists in your house and maybe in their classroom. And that's it. Right. Your world is everything. It's online. It's all these these politics and problems and life and whatever. Their world is very small. So when you do something like that and tell them that they're less important, that crushes their soul. And I did that twice this week. And that's why I made a commitment to myself. I was like, no, I can't do this. And it was ironic because I told the story very quickly. I had some work to do. And my son had hockey. And he goes, you know, daddy can take me. Is it nobody? And I can take it hockey. I've watched it because I look up to him that that's fine. No problem. He talks to me. I'm like that, too. When it was happening, I had to take him to hockey. And while I went to hockey, I was like, why still have to do this work? So I'm sitting there on my phone, was playing hockey. And when he was on the ice, I was watching.

Ben Pakulski: But between the games, I was in the middle of something and it comes can finish this. And I just want to wrap it up so I could put the phone down to look at it. And he goes, Hey, Ducky, I'm just a bit buddy. They keep going to see that. I go just a bit, buddy. I go. And like, no. Like, you know, he just got the impression that, you know, even if it's once that phone is more important than him. And that's just a terrible, terrible thing. So I need to switch that right. And so it's like no matter. He was okay with me not being there, but when I'm in front of him, I need to give him my time and attention, I guess is the point. And kids are so perceptive to these things. And I just gave him this message that, hey, man, you're not as important as my work. You know, as far as my phone or whatever the hell this I'm doing on this phone. And that's just a terrible message for building the amazing little humans that I'm hoping to develop.

Ben Pakulski: Right. I just want. I want to let these kids develop at their greatness and not put a bunch of B.S. on them, because I really believe we're all born great. We're all born with everything we need, all the love and all the caring and all the creativity and the desire. But it's all the B.S. that's put on top of you about your self-worth from people not giving you the value deserve. So, you know, slap myself on the wrist for that one kind of committed that that's not happening anymore.

Ashleigh VanHouten: It's amazing. The new book, I believe is called The Power of Showing Up. But Tina Bryson's written a number of books. So yeah, I think that'll be super, super helpful to people listening. And also the story you just told goes for any relationship in your life to write. Like sometimes we often take for granted the people that are the most important and the closest to us because we assume they're always gonna be there. Right. Like you could say the same for like talking to your parents or you go home on vacation, you spend time with them and like you're already sort of rolling your eyes or scrolling and scram because your parents are talking about whatever or, you know, your partner, your friends like these people who are the ones that are always there for you and have your back and love you unconditionally. They're the ones you should be giving the most attention and time. Right.

Ben Pakulski: So isn't that ironic? You know, that was you and somebody came up to me recently and said, hey, I want to build a business.

Ben Pakulski: And I have a really hard time getting clients. And, you know, I'm not really sure what to do. OK, well, who do you meet with or who do you see on like a week to week basis? Like, give me a list of all the people you see and talk to. And so they created this list of people formally started naming them off. Okay. Well, how much have you helped all those people? I haven't. Well, why not? Well, because, you know, they don't have the Skoal or whatever else, like, OK, well, here's the greatest opportunity of your life is the people who are sitting right in front of you. They don't have to be paying customers, but they're an opportunity for you to learn and to gain testimonials. Like if I help my mom lose 10 pounds. My mom is going to be my greatest advocate, felt my grandma, my aunts or my employees, whomever directly with their issues, with their goals, whatever the hell is this business? You're trying to build this. They're sitting in front of you like take the time. I know it's hard to get parents to listen to you, etc. But you have people in your life that right now you could help for free. And you're spending time with them anyway. So why not become the leader in your little community, your little group, your little tribe? Become the person that everyone goes to. For this one thing, you need to at least have that much knowledge. And if you don't think you have that much knowledge, well, then you probably shouldn't be starting a business, right? So have at least as much knowledge as we need to become the leader of your little tribe.

Ben Pakulski: I want to do that now. Okay. Now you've got testimonials. Now you've got people who believe in you. Now you believe in yourself. Now it's easy to approach someone in the gym or it's easy to approach someone in a business and go, hey, I can help you with this. Because that's confidence and that's what's missing in everyone's business. It's so simple. But everyone goes, well, I want to acquire customers. I want to acquire clients. What do you mean you want to acquire clients? You've got five hundred them in front of you. You just don't see every day go help people and then your clients will come to you because people will be telling you how great you are. Right. And that's. We talked with that before, Ash on the podcast where, you know, I try to live my life in a way that I don't have to tell people how great I am. Other people tell people how great I am gonna want to be the guy on social media with the megaphone. Going to follow me. I'm amazing. I'm gonna help you. To me, it's not my personality, right? Like, I want to be this person who's helping people. And then I want the people going, hey, man, this guy really helped me. That's what I mean. And that wasn't always my intent, to be honest. But that's organically would happen. That's what. It is if you help people, they will always tell others about it, and that's the beauty of life, is you don't have to go and show to the world how awesome you are. You wait for the world to tell you how awesome.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Ok, that's another really good Segway. That is probably going to be mildly embarrassing for you because I know you don't like to have people say sort of nice things in front of you. But we talked a little bit about giving back to the people who are taking the time to engage with the podcast. Right. And like, tell us what they've learned and tell us what they appreciate and what they're sharing with their community, because that's the whole point of us. Right. You're trying to teach people or like put information out there so they can use it and then share it with their community. And it's like this whole sort of ripple effect. And so what we want to do is respond to the people who are doing that. And so one thing that I would like to do, and I know it's embarrassing for you, but too bad is read like an awesome review. Maybe every Q and A and if this person hears the review and reaches out to us on Instagram at the Muscle Intelligence Podcast, we'll send them a thank you after you're OK with that.

Ben Pakulski: Of course.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Deal with it. They're saying it.

Ben Pakulski: It's great. And I'm so grateful for everybody that does that. And I'm grateful for you. Really get to know for to.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah, I know. That is the worst, right. Like I know when I do when I host like paleo magazine and I sometimes want like there's a really great review and I'm like, man, this is the corniest thing in the world. I have to read someone else telling me that I'm awesome. Like, I kind of love it, but it's a very weird feedback loop anyway. OK, so here is one review that I thought was really good. So this is from Keith Irving. So, Keith, if you hear this again, reach out to us on Instagram Muscle Intelligence podcast and we'll hook you up. But he says, I love this podcast because it always offers another topic, but also another perspective on the human body, the world we live in and how the two affect one another. As a bodybuilder, myself and personal trainer, I'm always seeking more knowledge. And this is my favorite place to go to listen to some real factual, valid knowledge and educate myself to go above and beyond. What most trainers do you get more than just information on training? It's a melting pot for all things health and longevity. Great work, ban and all the guests on the show. Thank you. And P.S., Ashley is the best. I added that part, but the rest of it. That's why I added the Ashley is the best. But yet anyway. So Keith, that was awesome. Like, that's the kind of thing that that really matters, though, is again, this engagement, because I'm sure you feel this like you have like a very sort of engaged audience on social media and stuff. But so often we're putting out the stuff that's like really, really deep and meaningful, at least to us personally. If you don't have people respond and say, like, this is what I got from this is what I think, or maybe I disagree with you on something like without having that engagement, I mean, there's really only so far we can take it, right?

Ben Pakulski: Yeah. Then that's one thing that always crosses my mind, right. Is this reality that I mean, I'm so blessed that I'm literally so humble every time somebody sends in a review like that. But I'm also aware of this reality that if someone doesn't like the podcast, they're not going to send us a review and go do do so. They're just going to come back. And I really want to do my best.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Some of them do. Sometimes some people say it's not that many, but. Yeah.

Ben Pakulski: But mostly time is just like my come. So I wouldn't be so conscious of clarifying who we are, what we do and what our mission is. And if we could do that for everybody. It's polarizing. We talked about beginnings. You know, if I can say in the intro what this podcast is both and you know, like either I like this guy and I like what is about or think he's full blown it about. And I really want to make sure it's polarizing like that, because then that's easy for the listener to go like this. I can share this right. In the simple question of referral in businesses, how likely are you to suggest this podcast? And if it's like a scale of one to 10, if everyone who's listening is an 8 and above or I do it 10, well then we're winning. We're doing a really good job on clarifying our message. And if we're not, then we're doing a poor job. We need to upgrade it and make sure the messaging is always harmonious, meaning we're always talking about the same topics. Rose Talking about things that people can relate to and other things going to be a hundred percent in alignment with what you what you want to hear it because maybe you like.

Ben Pakulski: I don't think that's important, but I also want people to learn to trust me in my ability to curate information and say, Hey, guys, this is important to pay attention to this. I'm shining a light in your eyes here. Pay attention to this if you're not already. It's very important. And hopefully eventually a lot of the listeners will follow, will trust us enough to come back regardless of the topic in just the intro. Doesn't say something that sounds appealing to the mystal. No. Well, then it wouldn't allow something on his podcast that was really, really important, really relevant. And that's kind of where we hopefully are very good at getting very close to being.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I love it. Can I ask one more crowd-sourced question before we wrap this up today? Absolutely. Because this is kind of cool and it's one that I actually really haven't seen before. But we talk a lot on the podcast. Maybe because I'm selfishly asking the question because it's related to me, but the idea of like sympathetic versus parasympathetic and how if you're always in a sympathetic state, how you can sort of bring yourself down and chill out or whatever. But this person was sending a message that they're the opposite, like they're always in this kind of chill, like calm sort of state. Congratulations. I must be nice. And they're asking the question, how? And in addition to breathing's, I'm sure breathing is one of the answers. What are some ways you can get yourself sort of like. Focused and mentally sharp and sort of excited and up regulated to like do a good workout, for example, or maybe like attack a really busy day of work. If you're somebody who just tends toward being just a little bit more chill and relaxed all the time.

Ben Pakulski: Well, this may be a dopamine thing, right.

Ben Pakulski: So if they're constantly getting bombarded with too much joking or if they had it, too as a kid or if they had some type of neurological or poor diet as a kid, all this stuff can kind of dumb regulate the sensitivity of your nervous system down, regulate your body's ability to make hormones, neurotransmitters, or maybe they're just to show that person like, I don't know that person's personality if it's actually like my child or my. So what I'm looking for, like lethargic, lethargic or apathetic, apathetic is the word I'm looking for. Right. So if you're apathetic, that's one thing that's completely different scenario than if you're just kind of chilled out. Right. So apathy is this idea of like I have no kind of motivation to get up or do things. I'm just really lacking desire. That's very different than if I have desire and get tired today. So, so many things that could go into getting you fired up. And I'll tell you, the simplest thing is sometimes you just have to dig into your soul and push as hard as you can right now. It's like exercise, right? Don't do it once a day. Don't do it once a week. Do it every day. And it doesn't have to be for a long duration.

Ben Pakulski: But you're creating that habit and you're creating new neural circuits that allow your brain to dig into these places that are challenging you, that are hard. You're creating the habit of hard work. And this is something that I'm so fascinated with. His habits are the foundation of success. Right. You know, Aristotle said it best. As you know, excellence is it's not an act. It's a habit. And that's just, you know, how do we create habits of excellence? How do we create habits of intensity? And every time I see myself acknowledging or not, sorry for some, I see myself creating a habit that I'm not happy with. And sometimes even though we speak in the podcast or my posture, when we're talking a podcast or, you know, any habit that I'm not really happy about. I break it right then and there. I am going to change this now. And, you know, I see myself getting slammed sometimes because you're so focused on certain things when you break it. And also, it's no longer habit, right? You start creating habit that goes in the opposite direction. So the person asking that question find the times when you feel like you have the most energy or the most motivation and use that to push your call it energy level from wherever you happen to be up a notch or three.

Ben Pakulski: Right. Like really tried to to use what you've got to increase the scope of your kind of the ascension of energy. So we want to get you up as high as we can so you come down lower. This life should be this balance of like I want to push hard and then we're recover hard. It shouldn't be this constant mediocre flux that exists in the middle. I want to be able to push up, you know, high amounts of neurotransmitters, high amounts of dopamine, adrenaline, cortisol, you know, really, really amplified, intense workouts, 700 squat. And then I want to go have a nap and meditate like a boot. Right. Those are my kind of opposite ends of the spectrum. I want to be able sprint to a hundred meters in 10 seconds and then won't be able to recover and breathe and be as calm as I can. Immediately. Right. It's a switch. So be able to access those states is literally the definition of resilience. And being antifragile is like I need to be able to attack and then calm down.

Ben Pakulski: Right. So that would be a good objective for people. You know, when you feel the desire to push a little bit or when you have that little bit of energy, use it and amplify it, turn up the volume by one, two, three knobs as much as you possibly can.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Awesome. I love it. I know you have to go. But thanks for the catch up and it's good to be back.

Ben Pakulski: Ash, I think you're great. Thank you. I think you're great co-host.
