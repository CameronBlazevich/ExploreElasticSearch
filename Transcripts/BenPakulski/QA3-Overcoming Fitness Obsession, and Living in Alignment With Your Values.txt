Q&A3-Overcoming Fitness Obsession, and Living in Alignment With Your Values

Ashleigh VanHouten: You were doing some top secret recording today with a certain chef. How did that go?

Ben Pakulski: Not top secret at all. So I told you I'm doing a cooking series because I think most people maybe overinflate how challenging cooking is.

Ben Pakulski: And certainly it's a skill and I don't want to give it away from the top chefs. But I think we can really empower people to enjoy food, enjoy better quality food if we teach them how to actually do it in really simple ways. So, you know, I love this this idea of leveraging my platform and my relationships to bring on, you know, some of the top chefs in the world and teach some of their simplest recipes that are meat and vegetables, meat, vegetables, fats. Right. So and, you know, I'm not attached to being Kito, but I think meats, vegetables, even animal or sorry, organ meats. I think all these things forget a simple recipe from all these amazing chefs and give you give it to people in five to seven minutes or less. I think that it's a really, really powerful opportunity that exists in France, especially in the fitness industry. Right. So simple. Very few ingredients like seven greens or less and meat, vegetables, fats. That's it. So is it. So we're here in Sydney and chef Pete Evans, who's evidently now that I know, is like a rock star over here. I had no idea. Right. Like I know Iverson knows he's famous and popular, but he's literally like Rockstar. I was super blessed to go to his place. And we cooked two amazing recipes.

Ben Pakulski: And you're just like men. That was literally seven minutes in some of the greatest food I've ever had in my life. So we obviously start with really high quality ingredients, but literally, you know, steak, steak tartare took minutes.

Ben Pakulski: And I think giving people that is so empowering when people say, I don't have time, I have to eat this things quick, or might my objective like how can we put together 20 to 40 recipes that people can do and literally no time flat knock it out. And now we've no excuses as to why we eat each other.

Ashleigh VanHouten: That's awesome. Yeah, I know. Obviously, I know of Chef Pete because having been in this sort of paleo world for a while, he's a big figure there too in North America as well as Australia. And I always thought we need to get to too deep into this, but I always thought it was interesting. I don't know him personally, but he would get like a little bit of flack for maybe having what people thought. I guess because he because he got so mainstream that the mainstream thought that he had some sort of kind of extreme views. And the only thing I've ever seen him talk about is eating like whole food and real food and and sort of just very what I consider normal kind of approaches to eating in life. So I don't know.

Ben Pakulski: I guess with that, yeah, he's getting on a flight from like the Australian government to like the equivalent of the Australian version of the FDA. And it's because he's perpetuating like, hey, you don't eat vegetable oils, you don't eat greens, you don't eat all these carbohydrates. It's all nonsense. And he's getting all these huge. I mean, you'd imagine how many billions of dollars exist in those large corporations to just a little high writer AI writers and higher magazines to bash the guy, right? Yeah. That they're trying to discredit him because he's really doing something great. And that's why him and I aligned are like him. And we have very similar views on this stuff. And we know we're not delusional about the fact that everyone's going to eat this way because it's I don't think it's even I mean, maybe hopefully it's possible, but who knows? But most people will continue to eat the way they eat. But we want to empower people to simplify it.

Ben Pakulski: So if you actually want to improve your fitness and your health, well, then now you have a very simple skill or a very simple tool base to be able to actually do it. We utilize Louie and like, ah, it's funny because our meals Louie sound identical, especially for our kids. It's okay. It's it's mostly meat, a lot of vegetables and a lot of fat and like that kind of simple. Right. And he has a really unique thought process around how to eat for the season. So in the summertime, he's looking for things that are, you know, more of a chef's perspective. Like I'm looking for things that a little bit more light and the things a little more a little more citrusy and a little more flavorful. In the wintertime, we're looking for these little more hardy and like more soups and more stews. And that makes a lot sense, you know? Yeah, I love that prospect. So, yeah. So those videos are objective is to record 20 to 24 YouTube videos and create YouTube series for other illnesses.

Ben Pakulski: That was a podcast with the best chefs around the world. And, you know, under this this pretense of what can we do in seven minutes or less with, you know, certainly under 10 ingredients. And my my objective is seven great ingredients or less. So we really simplified because ultimately I want it for myself. And I think millions of people out there would want it for themselves. And, you know, he was just so gracious to invite us into his home and it was awesome.

Ashleigh VanHouten: That's awesome. That is very exciting. I think the other cool thing about that, like the simplicity that you're saying that under seven minutes, because one of the things that I've found just being a lover of food my entire life, but talking to lots of chefs and recipe developers and stuff, is that there's certainly a time and place for like really fancy multi-day complex meals. And that's fine. But for most of us and even people who are really well-trained and really high level chefs, they like things to be simple. It doesn't have to be complicated to be good. And, you know, I get these questions all the time on social media. I'm always talking about my organ meats. People are like, well, how do you cook it? What do you do? How do you do it? What do you do? I'm like, I don't have a recipe for you even. I just like I just cook it. I just put it in a cast iron skillet and then I eat it like there's really not much work to it. Sometimes there is. But I mean, generally speaking, like you said, it's like you start with good ingredients and there's really not much you have to do after that.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. Yeah, totally. And I think the big thing is like if you're having it, like you said, an extravagant dinner with you and you're cooking for other people. Then let's make it an event. So let's make it something that's social and make it fun. Let's make it really extravagant. But most people are eating that way all the time. Most people, like, got fifteen minutes to eat. I don't have a lot of time. I've got some good, decent gradients. What should I do? I think that is kind of a niche that needs to be filled. I'm sure there's other people out there doing it. Just don't pay attention to them because most of them are kind of being my agreement laws. You know, like certain degrees. I'm not touching. You know, I'm certainly not going after I'm not going to consume corn and soy and wheat and grains and all these things. I'm like. You don't know. That stuff appeals to me. So how do I learn effective cooking methods for good quality ingredients, high-fat meals, meat based with an array of fresh vegetables. And that's kind of prefabs the preface of it and no. So I think it's I think it's a worthwhile endeavor that I'm hoping most people will appreciate it in listening. Sounds like this is a good plan. Just give us a shot on social media and if you have any recipes, you'd like to send a definite love to explore.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Awesome. Since you're in Australia, have you ever eaten kangaroo?

Ben Pakulski: Oh, often. I need to win in the US. Yeah, it's a.

Ashleigh VanHouten: It's almost like too lean. And you've seen those buff kangaroos with all their like crazy shoulder muscles. Like they're almost not like they're solely. And it's like not quite as good as other cuts. But it's interesting.

Ben Pakulski: Literally just got back from the grocery and he goes, I got 99 percent lean steak and it literally looks like nothing but tissue.

Ben Pakulski: There's none whatsoever. Yeah. Look, aparticular. Yeah.

Ashleigh VanHouten: So how is Australia so far? You've been there a couple days now.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah, only a couple of days. It's been fantastic. You know, the gym they were training. It is amazing. We were at a different gym two days. We've been to Kingdom Gym, which is in Brookville. We went to Titan Gym today, which is somewhere south of the city. Super, super nice. People are so hospitable, so kind and so welcoming. And it's been awesome. The camps are doing really well as far as sales. Sydney's doing I think it was sold out, if not sold out. Melbourne's very close. Melbourne's next week and the week after is Bolly. And we've still some spots for bowling. I'd love to have some our listeners join us in Bali for five, four days plus of amazing conversation, amazing food and blowing your mind with most building information.

Ben Pakulski: Obviously, Dubai was last week and was so awesome to teach with Milos. Me and my content so different than it's ever been in the past. I think everyone left there with an amazing, amazing skill set and amazing experience and malicious passion is unbelievable. Right. Like when he's done training, these clients do the workouts. He's sweating as much as they are, you know, and he's just like so into it and so committed to their success. I think that goes sometimes unnoticed in our fitness industry as so many trainers are taking your money and have no attachment to your success. And mulish isn't kind of known for saying things along the lines of you can do really well at this and you can go to Olympia. You can go you can get your pro card. And people say, you know, I was like, get out like bleep if you're not committed to that level. I don't want to work with you when I say that all the time. To anyone who signs up like venoms, ever been on call with me to say, hey, Ben, I want to work with you? The thing is, if I care about your success more than you do, we're not right for each other because I want everyone in my my stable to succeed. I want everyone to just crush it. If you're not willing to do that, you're in your vision. Isn't that clear? Something grand. I think you should take it personally. I'm I can take it personally. We're just not right for each other because I want people who are just willing and eager to crush one of the things that I think is just sort of top of my mind.

Ashleigh VanHouten: And you mentioned Milosh and I just watched the Super Bowl and I watched J-Lo, the halftime Super Bowl. And so I'm thinking about age and training and fitness and how we place ourselves in these boxes of what we expect from people of certain ages and how ridiculous and sort of self sabotaging that is. And this is something I think you talk about a lot, is that the things that you tell yourself about yourself is what's going to manifest. Right. So if you tell yourself that I'm I'm over the hill now or on past my prime or I'm getting old and so I can't do these things. That's what's going to happen. But you see people like him and you see J-Lo look just ridiculous at 50 years old last night.

Ashleigh VanHouten: And, you know, it makes you start to feel silly about feeling like, oh, you know, I'm like, I'm not 22 anymore. I kind of feel like whatever, I should start slowing down. And I think it's just super impressive. The people who who don't let these arbitrary kind of rules slow them down or tell them what they should be doing. It's just super impressive motions.

Ben Pakulski: Fifty six. And there's so many levels to that. Actually, it's like so his his standard of training is standard of nutrition when he was an athlete was so far above everybody else that for him to go at 3 percent or 30 percent of what he was before, he still I would say. Exceeding 90 percent of professional bodybuilders and certainly a physique, athletes and whatever men's physique, etc.. Just with what he's doing now. Standards. Right. That's a big, big part of it. Another thing that doctor who were in said to me that I think would be very relevant to the listeners and this was still boggles my mind to think about this very simple but yet profound. Very, very important to think about is he has and I'm going to quote him on this, but something to the effect of we all can live in two places at once. You can live in the now and the past. You can live in the now and the future you can live in in the future and the past. And he said most people live in the past and the future.

Ben Pakulski: Nope, not in the present. So if you're thinking about the past or you're thinking about the future, you're not optimizing this moment. And so what he suggests is you live in the now and in the here and then out. Right. So the now and the now, I'm not thinking about the past. Nothing but the future. You can certainly go there and conceptualize. Well, that's my goal. And that's going to really think about the past is something maybe I don't want to do again. I don't repeat, but not always the best idea. But if you live in the here and now all you end up optimizing this moment and that's all you can do. And that's the simplicity of life is it's not profound. It's just, you know, I came in. The only thing I control is, am I actually giving my all in this exact moment? And if I'm thinking about something of this, I'm not. And ninety nine point nine percent of people you meet can never give their all because, one, they're not focused. Two, they don't practice like anything else in life.

Ben Pakulski: Like, you know, your workouts or your your ability to write or your ability to read requires practice. You're not going to go from a relative amature or with someone of terrible focus to someone who's using rocks or overnight.

Ben Pakulski: It takes daily diligence, you know. So I want to be become really good at something. I need first just focus on doing my best in this exact moment and that's the only thing I can control and hopefully my thing my best. It is better than my best yesterday and I control those variables that kind of confound on that. That's the simplicity of that statement you're making there. Stop thinking about how old you are. Gives a shit. Who cares what you looked like in the past? Who cares what you felt like in the past, though that you control is, hey, am I doing things right now that are great, that are contributing to my greatness? Have I created a list of unconscious habits that are going to support that greatness? That's it. I haven't really been thinking deeply about this and been meditating quite a bit since being in Dubai. And I've got this theory now. I'm sure there's other people out there who have already come to this theory, but I'm looking at I've found yet. So any listeners we find some like this or if you've read something like this, please let me know. But it's this neurotransmitter view of personality, right? So it was people going after like mindsets, like an improving mindset, mindsets. Fucking bullshit. I think it's a joke.

Ben Pakulski: I don't think it's something you can physically change. I think mindset is a result of the neurochemistry that exists in your brain. So if you're someone who's lacking some neurotransmitters and you physically can't get there, you really don't see a chance against your mindset. If you wake up in the morning and you've got this huge brain bath of cortisol, you can't have a positive mindset. If you have any issues in your dopamine system, well, chances are you're not going to be chasing rewards. If you have an issue and you share Tonin system, whether you go to your brain, you're not going to feel good about yourself. You're not going to feel a sense of accomplishment. And so looking at this neurotransmitter view of life, I think we can really start to understand how to create what people will call mindset. And that requires not positive thinking. It requires action to change your brain, to change the neurochemistry like what can we do to make our brain work better, to have less cortisol, to have more dopamine, to have more. So calling more serotonin kind of perpetually in the certain list of habits that we know that can give us this positive cascade of neurotransmitters. Right. So I sit down and I feel grateful. Gosh, that gives me this feeling of endorphins and an end amide and all these things that are going to feel really good.

Ben Pakulski: And if I if I'd go for a walk when I'm done, I have this sense of reward and that's dopamine. I want to eat really well. I get top of me when eat like shit, what do I get? Cortisol, right? So it's just like this brain stew that you get to really tick every day. And if you're doing things that are working toward positive reward and positive mindset, positive feeling and we set our minds at positive feelings in your brain, we get those positive rewards and that becomes your default state. And if you get that, if you're always doing the things that fall short or you're not doing well enough, you're always negative. That creates a certain neurochemistry that your brain just you're not so happy anymore and eventually that becomes a default and that's a shitty place to live. So I've really been thinking deeply about this. And like I said, there's probably someone out there who's already well, well further along in this conversation than I am. I've actually reached out to Dr. Q to ask what is this concept ever your neurochemistry of the mind rather than the brain? So meaning your brain creates the mind, maybe, and the mind therefore maybe create the brain.

Ashleigh VanHouten: But yeah, I mean this just makes me think of a book that I've been reading lately that I've been telling everyone to read. I actually told you about it too. I'm sure know you're adding it to your list. The Body by Bill Bryson. And there's a quote in there somewhere that's life is just an endless chemical reaction, which I thought is actually. Of a romantic a little bit, but it's also super nerdy. But there's something there like what you're talking about, where it's sort of like a chicken and the egg scenario too, because I think when a lot of people hear people talk about mindset and creating a positive mindset or creating a productive frame of mind or whatever, they're really talking about enacting a lifestyle that helps your neurochemistry. Right. So it's like maybe it's just in the delivery of how people are trying to get these lifestyle factors that these these lifestyle changes across. Right. Because do I feel shitty? Because I'm. I have high cortisol or low dopamine or do I feel shitty because I just look at my phone all the time and I need to start creating systems that I don't do that all the time, that my neurotransmitters come back into into alignment. You know what I mean? So it's it's tough because sometimes you don't really know where it originated. Yeah.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah. Or both. Right. It's everything you do creates your mind, creates a brain. Right. So do I have a particular set of habits that I know is creating a positive neurochemical cascade in my brain? That's little yet. So I'm doing things that I know are creating a shitty response in my brain, like being on my phone, like being inside, like doing things that are stressful in a negative way or like dwelling on things for a long time. That's going to become your default state. Literates like, OK, what five things can I do today that will make me feel awesome and make me feel so confident, make me feel powerful, mutual, courageous. Make me feel joyful. All right. Feel fulfilled in all those kind of emotions should be embodied, meaningful, grateful rather than just conscious. Like I want to feel I want to embody them. And they were literally creating this neurochemical response. You can do it with gratitude. You do it meditation. You certainly do it with exercise. And those are kind of why those things have become foundational in everyone's life is unique. So it's people who are successful and like our you know, we're really doing real life. It's not by accident. Like everyone in the world who successful meditates, everyone loves successful exercises. Everyone. Most people of gratitude practice and like Hoshino life just so much better.

Ben Pakulski: This is what and again, like I said, I don't think I'm reinventing the wheel. I just come to this conclusion. I'm sure many, many, many, many, many years after other people. But this is just a really simple way for me to explain it to people is like everything you do from the food you eat, to the thoughts you think to the phone to exercise all or creating some type of neurochemical response in your brain and your body. And the fact that you can control it is life's greatest gift. It's also life scripts, nemesis right now and enemy or negative book, because it's certainly a challenge. So the challenge to realize like, hey, you're in charge of this and you can you can fix this and you can also really mess yourself up if you good.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Absolutely, I think I think you have one of your success principles that speaks to this. That's like this is part of it, but a small part of it. Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Pay attention the things you say about yourself, because that is massive. You know, you've seen you see these self-help things on Instagram. They're like, you know, would you speak to your best friend the way you speak to yourself? But there's there's a lot of truth in that.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Like, we will we will look in the mirror or we'll look at our lives or the things we're doing or the things we haven't done yet. And we will shit all over ourselves like verbally in a way that we would never do to other people. We have so much more understanding and empathy for the people in our lives that we love than we do for ourselves sometimes.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I think it's worth kind of bringing that back a little bit too, and it's great to work hard and to want to improve and to want to always be better. But you can't improve upon a situation that you have no respect for or love for. You know, if you don't love yourself, how are you going to make anything better?

Ben Pakulski: Have so many levels to that. And again, the other one that we posted recently was when it sucks, smiles, smiles and interrupted him and said, do this so much brilliance. Not because, you know, something he's been quantifying in the lab for years is this idea of like we're hijacking the dopamine system. So you're getting into the deepest depths of something challenging. You're obviously going to have cortisol norepinephrine being released. And these are the things that typically cause stress and cause ultimately adaptations. It's only wrong with stress. It's know. How long is that there? Is it there for a good reason then he says. But by smiling, maybe. And again, I don't want to quote him on anything, but maybe we are kind of hijacking the dopamine system, meaning when we smile, we're telling our brain there's a reward. And rather than saying, oh my God, this is terrible, this is punishment. Now we're going, Hey, Brain, there's a reward. Oh, I like this. Let's do this again. There's a reward, you know, like, hey, I feel good about this. Or maybe it's like the equivalent of a celebration at the end of a challenge or you climbing a mountain. The amount was terrible, was very, very hard. Yes, I made it. This is this accomplishment, the celebration.

Ben Pakulski: So similar idea rather than just kind of letting this negative loop perpetuate. Maybe we could see the positive in that and switch it into something that's very useful. So I told a friend of mine that I talked about this LibDem podcast. So speaking on this path of children. Right. So if you look at children, people always like, oh, my kids, they grow up to be great, happy people. And this is, I think, the simples. Maybe this is complex for other people. But the simplest way for me to understand it is all you have to do is find ways to control their neurochemistry. So do I want my child in front of a computer or video games or a phone or. Well, you're going to desensitize the reward system. You're going to mess the dopamine system and therefore they're going to need greater amounts of dopamine in the future to achieve any type reward. Well, that's a big problem. Let's not do that. They need to go outside because they're going to get this whole positive neurochemical cascade of connecting with nature. OK, let's do that slowly. This is like do do not do checklist of like don't worry so much about the little stuff. Just worry about creating a great neurochemistry in their brain.

Ben Pakulski: That happens from sleep, that happens from smoking, that happens from play and that happens from complex movement and happens from joy and comfort and love. And, you know, you get oxytocin when they feel when they feel like they're secure. And if we can create this whole neurochemical cascade of things that just deliver a positive neurochemistry, nothing in life will stop these people. Right. Like people I was at, I had already my son's going to be strong or get to him. My kids are learning like, no, you don't. Their brains will learn so fast and so much if you just keep them out of stress. If you just keep them out of fear and anxiety and worry and trying to keep up with everybody else, and you just keep them out of that. Their brains are just so plastic. They're hypoplastic until a 21 year old. So just keep him out of that. And then their brains will do exactly what they should and they'll never feel bad. They'll always be happy and fulfilled. And just full of love and joy, because that's the only thing that their brain knows. And is this idea of actually trying to will your way out of, let's say your you know, you won't get us a girl, but maybe. But as a man, you're testosterone is zero testosterone supposed to be somewhere between seven and nine hundred.

Ben Pakulski: And it's it's let's call it 50. You can wheel your way out of it all you want and go have a positive mindset. I'm strong, you're fucked. Like you stand a chance. Right. You have to get you have to get your hormones to this high level for you to actually function correctly. And I really believe that neurochemistry is the same. And again, I'm not an expert in this stuff, but this is just kind of what I'm hypothesizing is there are way stronger signal than just trying to will your way into something. Right. So if you have someone who's like, hey, man, you got a good willpower, like you didn't even stand a chance of having willpower, what you need to do is create a small list of daily habits that allow you to create these positive neurochemical responses in your brain. It's so simple. It's the same stuff we talk about every day. Right. This is just kind of been my ponderings lately as I dive deeper into understanding neurochemistry and ultimately how we can help people shift the way they think, the way they feel, the way they they live. We can do this with the simple things, the gratitude, the meditation, the exercise. Smiling, right.

Ben Pakulski: Being joyful, being around people you love and eating great quality foods. You don't create stress and information. And there's so many things in my life that have kind of all pointed to this one direction that I'd be stupid or blind to not see it at this point. And I'm so blessed to be able to share. Hopefully this stuff is valuable to people.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah, I think it's I think it's so useful to keep coming back to you and keep touching on it. I think another important thing about this approach that you're talking about, this way of looking at this challenge, is that you're also taking away some of the stigma around a lot of the negative health issues that a lot of us are dealing with, whether it's dudes who have super low testosterone, who have a hard time talking about that or dealing with that or expressing that, whether it's people who are anxious or have anxiety or have fibroid issues and they have health problems and they're overweight and they feel shitty and they don't want to go to the gym. All of these things. And they think it's just because they're the weak ones or they just aren't. They don't have enough willpower. They just aren't disciplined enough. And there's there's there's something to be said for having discipline and working through things and all that stuff. But take a look at it. To approach it like this is a chemical thing. This is a neurotransmitter thing. This is a physiology thing. This is something that we can look at pragmatically and hopefully sort of objectively and unemotionally and not look at it like it's a character flaw. And look at it as here's here, the steps we can take to start addressing these issues and fixing them. You know, and I think it's really important because no one gets better by being shamed into it, you know, by being told you're weak or you're not good enough or you're not strong enough or you're not smart enough. Right.

Ben Pakulski: So I think that making it work. Yeah, literally. Again, we're epsco and you don't stand a chance. Life is set up to be that way. Such that like if you keep thinking about something negative, it's going to perpetuate itself. And people always talk about that, like whatever you think about, you bring more. Well, that's the reason is because if I'm thinking about something stressful, the reason I bring more of it in is because I'm perpetuating more stress and cortisol and all these negative hormonal responses. Right. And that's not what I want. Like I want to have the positive release of I want to feel oxytocin, which will serotonin I want to feel and undermined and all these other amazing neurotransmitters that are kind of our reward or positive chemistry, we could just create it. And if you do, if you get that, how you're bringing in more of it, let's do more of that. Same with exercise as a great book. I just about halfway through called The Joy of Movement. And we'll get Dr. Kelly McGonagall on your soon. Just talking about that is the human brain was was rewarded in time evolutionary for movement.

Ben Pakulski: Right. So that's why movement is such a positive thing. And people think you have to, like wheel yourself and to do it or it's just not. That's just there. Like if your brain is healthy, you're not malnourished or you're not very sick. If you just move, you will get the positive response from just moving right in. It's so simple that people go camping. It's that simple. Just move. You will get the positive neurochemistry that you're looking for. And movement can be anything. You know, what I suggest is breathe, walk, meditate, everybody breathe. It's the most reflexive thing we do. And walking is the second most reflexive thing we do as humans. And we have to be very good at those before we can create a foundation of health optimization above that. Meditation is exercise for your brain, learning how to control your emotional states and ultimately create your emotional states again. Sound like a broken record sometimes, but I think it's so simple. And yet that makes it profound, right? It makes it so profound to allow people to realize like everything you need is already right there. Everything you need is already inside you.

Ben Pakulski: You just have to get out of the way and stop allowing yourself to go down these negative perpetuating loops. Keep yourself focused on the things that really, really make a difference. And the three things that you could do every single day is pretty walk, meditate. And they should be conscious and they should be often and they should be deliberate and maybe even effortful. And maybe there's a sense of urgency involved, meaning like I will have some objective, like I want to get better at this rather than just arbitrarily. You know, I think when you don't have a sense of urgency, you don't hold yourself to a high standard. So maybe it's like I want to do this amount by this point. That's why we're very goal directed beings. So we want their brains need urgency. Again, another Huberman brilliant point. So, again, so many things that exist within us. And yet we're all seeking the supplement or the seven day program or the book or like it's so simple. It's all right there in that note. So there's people teaching, hey, this is how you breathe correctly. Learn that like everybody move heaven and earth to go learn how to breathe correctly because you're not right. And every time you do a class and you're looking around to watch people breathe, and I can tell by their posture and I can tell by the depth of their breath.

Ben Pakulski: And we do breath holds and everybody sucks and is just so bad. And it's not their fault. It's never been taught because people think it's all you breathe. It's not supposed to be conscious. No, you have to do this thing correctly because otherwise you're literally creating stress in your brain. And again, this is part of the course that we teach here in Australia and Bali and stuff like you have to learn to control this thing. And here's why. Right. This is what happens when you don't. Meditation is so, so simple, yet so complex, so many levels, but just taking time to be silent and be still and be right. We've talked about this before, but most people have to do right. Everybody is attached in this society to doing well. Being rather than doing is effectively what meditation is is just existing and being and being present in your body, being present in your mind, you're just existing and thinking about nothing. Ultimately and feeling your breath and feeling your emotions and being present with what your body feels. That's meditation, the foundation of, like I said, this complex. But meditation can be very, very vast.

Ben Pakulski: But certainly starting off with the foundation of just be.

Ben Pakulski: Don't do if you have to get up on my phone, I have to do this. I have to do. I have to do have to do know be first. Right. If you can be everything else will be better. Your perception of life will be better. And again, sounds like a rant I guess, but not the intent.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I love it. I'm actually I'm literally making efforts right now. I'm such a nerd. I'm making notes. OK, on that note, I do have a mindset sort of mental mastery question I was post on social media that I think is related to the conversation we've been having and I wanted to ask it. This was sent in by a male individual and I think it's important to note that because I think when we're talking about emotions and anxiety around fitness, it's a conversation that I think is a little bit easier for women to have because we're more encouraged to talk about our doubts and our fears and things than men are, especially in sort of the world of iron and muscles and being tough like guys aren't allowed to talk about feeling self-conscious or anxious about things. And with this question, I would ask you to kind of think about maybe not the band that you are now, but the band that you were maybe when you were competing. Right. And you were, as you said before, really myopically focused on this one goal that you had. Right. And the question is from this individual who is a bodybuilder and they're like big into fitness and wellness and being big and all this stuff. And it's kind of fucking up his entire life like he's talking about how he's basically obsessed with it, but to a point where he's miserable and he's obsessive and he's like crying in the bathroom at the gym because he's basically just sort of freaking out about not being happy, never being happy with where he is, what he's doing. And his question is how how to move forward in life with fitness and wellness being a part of his life, but not having this obsessed. So anxiety filled approach to it like you can't. He doesn't want to, I guess, quit cold turkey, but he can't keep going on the way he is. It's a dysfunctional part of his life. So what advice you have?

Ben Pakulski: Sheesh I think we could do an hour-long podcast. You have Ash, that's one of those that like Reb. you're just spewing a bunch of stuff. And I can certainly say what comes to mind, but I'd really like to be mindful. Yeah. Really to be mindful of that, because I know there's thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people out there living that reality where you know, and I did the same.

Ben Pakulski: Right. I don't know if it was maybe I was the same extent it was where you're so discontent with everything you've done, because for whatever reason and I don't speculate what his reasoning is. Right. Maybe it's some level of inadequacy that just everything you do is inadequate. Or maybe it's you're not celebrating when you do things that are positively moving in the right direction. But whatever it is, the intention of what you're doing is in the wrong place. Right. So we're training because maybe we dislike ourselves or we're training because we're unhappy. So rather than celebrating the body, then rather than celebrating your effort and celebrating your discipline. Now you're making it a punishment rather than a reward. I get to exercise today. I get to have a great workout with my to my great friends today. You know, I get to use my legs. My lungs still work.

Ben Pakulski: So when I wake up in the morning, ash is like, you know, I don't even know what I was, what time I. Oh, my. I don't even know my eyes. I smile and I just feel and I go, wow.

Ben Pakulski: I actually woke up to my heart beats in my chest and I knew nothing about it. My lungs breathe. And I do nothing. I don't breathe. They breathe for me. You know, I don't think about moving my hands. I don't think about my mind. My mind just turns on. I did nothing to deserve that. I could cut myself and I'd heal. And I didn't do anything for that. I'm so, so grateful for that. Like, I don't have to do anything. It's just there. I get to use these eyes. I get to use this mind. What am I doing to optimize that? Right. I get to use all these body parts. And I didn't do anything to deserve them. They just showed up. And I think taking that perspective and taking an attitude of gratitude into what you do and going, holy shit, like I get to use these muscles. I'm so grateful that I'm borrowing this meat suit. Random borrowing the suit.

Ben Pakulski: It's not mine forever. I'm just going to do as much as I possibly can to enjoy this adventure. That perspective for me is powerful, right? Rather than saying I have to maintain some level of physical fitness. I have to be shredded all the time. I have to train hard.

Ben Pakulski: I have to eat really well, man. No, you don't. You're so blessed. Now, again, Sam Harris, I'll give him full credit for this, offers a meditation that says, what if you died today? What would you give to comeback? Just one more time.

Ben Pakulski: And to kiss your family or to kiss your children or to, you know, spend one more day with the people you love? Or what if you lost your legs today? Or what if you lost your ability to walk? What would you do for just one more day to come back and that perspective? OK. If you can't feel I've used this example before, but if you can't feel gratitude after that, something's wrong. Let's practice that. Right. And I think that perspective for everybody to learn to celebrate this body that we're given to just take a moment, to be present with this body, to love this body, you don't realize that it's transient. It's not here forever. This exact state, very likely for most people, is the best you'll ever be. And hopefully we can continue to make it better. But it's certainly the youngest you'll ever be in. You'll certainly never get this more pack. And what am I doing in this moment? Just honor the fact that I'm here. The fact that I'm alive. The fact that I can breathe. The fact that I'm looking at the sunshine. The fact that I get to exist in this amazing world and the most incredible time in the history of humankind with everything evolving and growing and so much opportunity in abundance. And I just flew through the air and a metal tube to go to a different continent and like back. This is amazing. And if you can't feel it in your soul, that doesn't let your heart on fire. I think we need to explore it a little bit more. Right. Spend a little more time exploring that. And hopefully most people can just realize men.

Ben Pakulski: Life is amazing.

Ben Pakulski: And the fact that you get to work out, the fact that you decide to push your body further than most people ever would. It's another Sam Harris's 7 billion people would change places with you and in an instant, 7 billion people. That's pretty fucking profound. And if that doesn't change your mind in some positive way, again, I don't know the specific scenario this person is experiencing, but I hope in some minor way that was prospective for them. If not, let's let's get a little deeper on that question. You know, maybe that person can can give us a voice note. If you head over to Muslim towns, dot com slash podcast, you can actually leave us a voice note that we love. To hear from you. What is it like? Tell me a little bit more about it. Maybe it's a dialogue, maybe it's a conversation, right? But I don't know. But again, I'm certainly not an expert. I don't want to claim to be giving advice. Right. I just want to offer perspective. Hopefully, guys, if that helps.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I hope I mean, maybe it's because it's late at night. Maybe it's because I didn't get enough caffeine today. But I'm feeling a little emotional from that right now. Don't tell anybody about it. But that was pretty incredible. Like that was pretty moving for me to hear. And I think that, again, I don't know the details of this man's story either, but I think that ninety nine point nine, maybe every single person on the planet can still take something from what you just said, because it's all perspective. Our life is all perspective. Everybody. There's there's billions of people out there with harder lives than us. There's hundreds of thousands, millions of people with easier lives than us. And it matter. What matters is what you're living in and your reaction to it. And I think that what you're saying, which is having this gratitude for just the wonder of waking up every day and being able to walk through life is pretty incredible. And it kind of puts a lot of the sillier things maybe or the less consequential things that we stress out about in perspective. So, yeah, that was amazing. Thank you.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Thanks, Ash. So one final thing that I want to mention is now something that really made bodybuilding challenging for me was this person may be experiencing this as well. I'm actually experiencing this right in this exact moment. And I'll tell you why. Living out of alignment with your values. So, you know, when I was a bodybuilder, I loved the idea or thought it loved the idea of being the greatest people on the planet. But it's such an ego centric drive that it's so selfish. It's only about one person right. In that. At the time, I didn't think about that. And maybe that's why this person I don't know, but maybe that's why they're not feeling great about it. So most of us who live with some level of anxiety have some misalignment with who they are at their at their sole right, at their core values. Here's my example and I'll share it with you guys. I know that my highest value is my family and I value my children more than anything in the world. And they feel my soul. And I'm on this planet to love them and to be with them every minute. And the fact that I'm here in Australia and they're not rips my soul apart. And I'm literally like turned to tears right now. But I know I'm out of alignment. I didn't know that until I left. It takes me leaving to feel that. And I hope that I never have to do it again in my life. But I'll tell you what it does. I can't change the scenario.

Ben Pakulski: I'm here now. I'm going to be here in the moment and I'm gonna be positive and I'm going to love the moment. I get to love my experience, but I'm going to cherish every single breath that I have with them, every single second, every single moment, every single smile that I get with those children. And when it when I'm with them. So that makes me appreciate it. So all these people who live with some level of anxiety oftentimes are living out of alignment with who they are, their soul, who they are, their dharma. Right. What is your source say? And may people forced are forced into situations where they don't want to be there. Something is at a moment. And if you feel that. I hope you work toward changing it. And I hope when you are able to change it and work back into what we value most, you can just appreciate it on orders of magnitude. Right? So for me, being away from my kids is a blessing and a curse because I literally have anxiety. Twenty three hours a day and we are that I don't is because I'm on the phone with them and I'm talking to them and telling them how much I love them and miss them. And it's a challenge. And I think many people live with that and I live with that as a bodybuilder. This reality that I knew I had something more important planned for me unconsciously. My my soul knew there was something bigger to help more people. But yet the only thing I could focus on on this one selfish endeavour like this is all about me and a most important thing in the world.

Ben Pakulski: And I needed to go through that to realise that it's not the case. Right? It's bullshit. Building muscle is fucking awesome. Don't do it because. Well, I should have said don't put everyone else aside while you're doing it right. It doesn't have to be that way because it's not fulfilling. Just like making money. I can make one hundred million dollars in the next five years, but if I am a dick to everybody along the way, you're not going to feel good with yourself at the end of it. And that's why 90 percent of. Maybe exagerated will say 40 percent of our population is taking some type of anti depressant anti-anxiety sleep medication because they can't live with the anxiety of not being kind to people, not being truthful of who they are. We mistreat other people when you manipulate other people. Not saying that it did, but like I know I'm thinking about many people who do, who do. There's going to be anxiety. There's going to be this internal mal alignment with your with your dharma. So find what your dharma is. Well, that means basically what your soul was meant to do, why your soul is here, whatever fills your soul fills your cup, and you have to live in alignment with that. Otherwise you will experience fear, anxiety, resentment, inadequacy, because you just can't measure up. And it was maybe a little deeper.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Thank you for sharing that. I think a lot of people who are listening probably resonate a lot with that. And I know that our listeners like it. When you get a little personal and talk about some of the things that maybe you're challenged with or the issues that you're facing. And I have to say, like we talked about this a little bit, when you're traveling the world and doing all this cool stuff and everybody else is looking at it like, well, you got to go to Bali and you're like, I miss my kids. And I will say, you know, I don't have kids. So I can only offer a different kind of advice. But as somebody who has a partner who was in the military and was in active duty warzones for half of the year, and I know what it's like to be away from people that you love. So I will say this is a piece of advice that I did give you off-line that I know you I'm sure you've received and you understand it. But if the reality is that you are going to be away from people that you love, the best thing you can do during that time is is crush every seconds that you're away from them and get the most out of it and enjoy it and be fulfilled with the work that you're doing and know that you're doing important work too, because your kids also see that like they see you doing your work and helping people and changing people's lives. And that's something that's going to inspire them and strengthen them, too. So it's it's worth saying that what you're doing is important, even if it does hurt to be away from your kids, right?

Ben Pakulski: Yeah. Thanks. I guess it's a challenge because the reality is in this life, we only get one chance.

Ben Pakulski: And I know I wouldn't be fulfilled if I didn't fulfill my souls dharma to impact as many people as possible. That being said, I feel as though my kids can be part of that. I feel like there should be a part of it, and I'm working toward building that into my life too, where they can come with me and they can see these these positive impacts and having they could see how hard I work and how much I love what I do and how much passion I have and how much I help. So people selflessly in altruistically and it's never motivate from a negative place. And I'm setting my life up so that I can bring with me and we can homeschool with travel. We can have these adventures and will make this amazing life because I don't know how long you need to be here. And ultimately, I just want to be here, here and now in every moment as a human says, it's like be here now. Not the future, not the past. And that's my objective. I'm working towards setting them up as soon as I can. And they've come with me on every trip I've had in the past for the most part since I've been born. Many of them. But it's really just lately that for me, Trip was obviously longs have been away. So it's it's a challenge. It's a challenge. But as long as every minute that I spend with them and every minute I talk to them, they know that the most important people in my life and I want to get too much into my own personal stuff.

Ben Pakulski: But hopefully people understand that it's OK to live out of alignment with your values because it allows you to determine what your values are. But when you do live out of alignment, when you get the chance to go back. Appreciate it and go, wow, like this. Now I know what fills my soul. I know where I should be. And hopefully it's for your soul and not fulfilling someone else's soul, because I know there's a lot of people out there who are living their life to keep other people happy. And that's not interesting. Good place to live, because if you're trying to keep someone else happy, it's certainly a bad place to exist. Like you need to live your dharma and your happiness and your bliss while they live their bliss. And if those two souls are complementary to each other and one plus one equals three. Now we have a successful relationship. Right? Whereas if people are not living in alignment with their values and their dharma, well, that's when things should just end. And it shouldn't necessarily be negative. It should just be you know what? You're doing your thing. And I don't ever want to impede that with some negative emotions. And I'm doing my thing. And you didn't see that some negative emotions.

Ben Pakulski: So let's just agree that, you know, we're going to each live our greatest life individually, each other and support each other, never what we can. But ultimately, again, it's hard because someone who will become dependent and tentacles become deep. I think it's also valuable to acknowledge that you are here on this planet for a short time to live your dharma, live your greatness, impact your soul. And I hope everyone gets to find that at some point in their life.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Sometime I'm going to post on social media some pictures, some candid shots from the Tampa muscle camp for people who think that Ben is just always stoic and kind of scary. I have pictures of him with his kids where he just has the biggest smile on his face. And like, there it is. That's all you need. You just need to bring the kids are out. And he's just the happiest guy in the world. I felt those people who think that you never smile couldn't stop Drew.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah.

Ben Pakulski: I mean, I tend to be mostly business when I'm not with my family, but when I'm with my family, I just can't. Stuff like that. Smiling is the only thing. My face. That's how to do when they're around me, when I'm talking. Right. Right. So that was my soul to allow me to go and work hard. Everything else that I do. And now we talk about that right after we talk about planning, joy. Right. I talked to my kids every day, both so I can set their mind and enjoy joyful place and know they're safe and secure and and loved and mine. Also, right. Selfishly, like, I need to I need to or want to always feel my soul and let them know how much joy they bring to me so that I can go out and as you say, just put the pedal down and burn through all the gasoline while I'm not with them. Go back and I refill my tank. And again, certainly not perfect, but certainly a conscious work in progress.

Ashleigh VanHouten: All right. Well, this is definitely one of the deeper Q&A as we've had, and I'm very grateful for it. And I think that if anyone feels like they just had a mini therapy session, they can just pay. Tell me what they would normally pay a therapist. Send it to me. Not Ben, because I need the money more than he does. And we'll see how people test.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I just have to end it on a lighter note, because, you know, it's deep. It's a lot.

Ben Pakulski: Thanks, Ash. So normally we'd have a sponsor for the podcast, guys, but there is no sponsor today.

Ben Pakulski: We certainly have some we could be thrown at you, but hopefully you guys are taking time to acknowledge our sponsors because they're there truthfully, brands that I value and I align with. And we've certainly given shout outs to Bubbs in the past. OB's naturals, blue blocks, fresh press, olive oil. Chile had so many amazing brands that are supporting the podcast that continue to support the podcast. You know, hopefully you guys support those brands and try the products. And if you have we love to hear from you. Let us know how it went.

Ashleigh VanHouten: You can Vegemite to sponsor us since you're in Australia. Can you bring me some of that control?

Ben Pakulski: We have some of the fridge and try to get mulesed either. But he hasn't caved yet.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Have you tried it? What do you think? Course.

Ben Pakulski: I think it's the most disgusting food like products of this world. And I'm pretty open minded.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Worse than Cheez Whiz? That's the American food product. And we're heading. I've never had it. I would love to try it. I have a sneaking suspicion that I might like it because I like things that warning us are fine.

Ben Pakulski: I promise you cant. This and I'm pretty open minded the stuff I got. Listen, I would eat worms by way requited Vegemite. It's not really grills. I guess that's just the novelty.

Ben Pakulski: Of course, you're gonna get so much since you know you're a natural administrator and we're you know, we're going shoot a YouTube video of you just. And this is how I tried it. It wasn't like, well, let's like spread it on some toast. There's like a terrorist go.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Of course. Good.

Ben Pakulski: I almost vomit. Like I was appalled that anyone actually likes Vegemite. I just can't imagine anyone liking the days, this stuff. I'm really excited now that I guess you're going to be brought to you by most intelligence. And we have some programs that we would love to get you guys involved with. And you know, as this this content evolves, I'm almost daily now producing content around not just muscle, but everything else that goes into it. So which is why I'm here in Australia and Dubai and Bali doing these camps. Fosca One in UK we've now just announced one in Ireland and all those are available at muscle camps dot com. If you want to come in and chat about this stuff and maybe learn a little bit more about all of the things that go into building your greatest body, and that does include mindset and that doesn't good stress management, that doesn't good sleep optimization and mindset and your environment and obviously training and nutrition up there as well. So Keirstead muscle camps, dot com is a place to go. We do still do have some spots left. And I would love to have all of you guys join those space subs limited times limited. But we do do our best to keep the group small so that we can give everyone individual time and attention so that you leave there feeling like you are now on the path to whatever it is you're objectively trying to do, whether it's losing fat, bully muscle or just being more joyful and happy. We talk a lot about that. So I appreciate each and every one of you tuning into the podcast. And as I said, like that gratitude that I feel every day when I realise what I get to do.

Ben Pakulski: And I tell everyone, I've never worked a day in my life. And I've just get to learn and connect with incredible people and gets talk to you every week. And I'm so blessed to have wonderful people in my life. Hopefully everyone can be so blessed as to live their dream and never work a day in their life. And I get a lot of people. So I have to. You don't. We can certainly start working toward when you have a passion for something, regardless what it is. People will start to pay because of your passion. And then there's a park, as they did in the old muscle expert podcast with Phil McKernan. And I suggest everybody goes into that because it was very, very impactful, actually, to get him back on ash. If you want to make that happen. Yeah, I think I'll listen. We'd love to hear from Kearney's an Irish guy. I'm going to Ireland in April. Actually, he lives in Boulder, Colorado. So we get him on. I'd love to love to love to love to speak to him again soon. Helping people find their passion and get rid of the bullshit stories of Tom Sophist. Well, they can't. We're changing the world, guys. Screw this bullshit 9 to 5, living inside the box stuff. Let's all get outside to find our dharma, get uncomfortable and find our greatness. So for myself and the amazing Ashley Van Houten, Nawaz Sharif. Keep you up so late. I appreciate you staying here. I'm signing off from Sydney, Australia. Have an amazing day, ladies and gents, and live your greatest life in a body.
