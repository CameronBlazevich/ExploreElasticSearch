Q&A1-How to train for a small, stable, strong waist

Ashleigh VanHouten: Welcome, everybody, to the Muscle Intelligence, Q and A. We have a ton of good questions coming and a lot of inspiration because B Pak is currently in Colombia making all of us jealous, right?

Ashleigh VanHouten: Is that where you are right now?

Ben Pakulski: Yes, I'm in Colombia. I'm in Medellin. I'm not here to make anybody just. I'm here to play.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Well, that's just us.

Ben Pakulski: I'm here to plan my life for 2020. Get a lot of work done. I'm literally in hermit boat. I'm doing semester minding. I'm doing some business meetings. And I'm also writing my course content for twenty, twenty at least as much as I can in three weeks. There's a lot to do. It turns out that I have a lot of business management stuff as well. So I've been telling people this for a while, but I'm launching coaching and launching mentorship kind of at the same time. So mentorship will be probably very, very small groups like 10 to 12 people and business mentorship. Right. Like helping you build the brand, you make more money. So some really, really committed coaches.

Ben Pakulski: You're obviously looking for fitness, education, but most importantly, how to grow business. And I going to run that personally and that will have the physique coaching, which we have always had. Just going to scale it. And we have this platform that's being built and there's so much management that goes into that. It's. We were supposed to be ready for October 1st and that were to December. It is still not ready, at least not to my standards. So it's pushing and pushing and pushing it and ours. Hopefully shooting for January 1st. But all these things are just time and management and a need to expand my team. I'm just as, you know, as very slow to hire. After many years of being in business, it's very easy to hire quick and make a mistake. So I'm just looking for great people who are very organized, very integrative with taking all this amazing ideas, amazing information we have and turning it into easy to consume online courses, online products, etc., etc. So my needs are extensive, but I'm not in any rush.

Ashleigh VanHouten: So that's a lot of stuff to work on.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Three weeks in Colombia. 

Well so literally I'm up at 4 months. I was up at 5:30. It's 4:30 just hammering away until maybe 7:00 at night. And we'll go to dinner at 7:00 at night. It's long and get my workouts and I'm getting some walks in kind of intermittently, but it's literally like sit in a cafe. My ass is too short to sit there and go for half an hour walk and then go to the next cafe. So it's and there are some workspaces.

Ashleigh VanHouten: People underestimate how important it is to hire people. I think it's not necessarily even that they underestimate it, but it's when you're thinking about building your own brand in your own business, people often are, you know, obviously very focused on what they're capable of doing and what they're going to produce and what they're going to put out into the world. But having the right people around you is like everything. People don't realize how much work it takes to to find the right people, to train the right people, to just get people who are sort of have the same vision as you like. That's an incredible amount of work.

Ben Pakulski: Right. And so my mission, vision for 2020 is literally making money is inevitable. When you have your heart in the right place. So my vision for 2020 is to connect with people who want to make it impact that will make so much more money. Right. And that's the objective is not focusing on the money, just focusing on how can we help more people. Yes, we talk with us to fill up. But, you know, one thing we might well talk about, since we're on that topic, ashes, like anyone out there who's going to fitness business or who wants to create a fitness business, whether that be in person or online, there's a certain number of things you need to build to do. Right. And, you know, you build this amazing fitness skill set, which I've done for 20 years. And then you have to transfer it into understanding business and how to grow it and how to acquire attention and how to acquire leads and how to convert them into sales. And there's a lot that goes into that. Right. I've been doing it since 2011, so I've made a lot of mistakes and a lot of great things. I've met a lot of people. So there's obviously, you know, the facets of business and, you know, looking for people to help with lead acquisition, looking for people with help with branding. Looking for people to help with design. Looking for people to help with content creation and video production and then funnel creation and then copywriting for emails. And it's extensive. There's a lot of fast as they go into that. And then for me, it's so specific to the content that I teach.

Ben Pakulski: Like the person needs to be competent in the content and competent in the skill set of whatever they're trying to do for me, whether it be building funnel or helping me with whatever lead acquisition or management of systems like. So if it goes into it. So that's the kind of stuff that I'm going to help a small number of entrepreneurs with connecting with my network and help them just, you know, scale from where they are to where they want to be in it. It's always a graduated ascension of the ladder. It's not overnight. But, you know, that's the plan is to do six and twelve months mentorships. And some of it will be very focused on business and some will be very focused on fitness, because obviously to get better results in sales and fitness, you have to be really good at what you do. So not only has to be the best in the world, what you do are very good at what you do. You have to then be able to get someone's attention with marketing and with social media and social media. Such a blessing to people who want to be successful in business and just learning how to kind of leverage that to your best advantage.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Is this something that you do every year, like some of these kind of concentrated go somewhere and do this work sort of like a rocky prep, but for business?

Ben Pakulski: Yeah. I usually do a week or so this year going through X because I've so much more on my plate. I just. Get organized. So, again, these three courses that I'm building. So because not only do you have to research and document, you have to create, you have to organize the thoughts and it's come as extensive process, you know? So there's that. And then on top of it, you're stacking all these other things like managing the creation of this coaching platform and then managing the creation of new products and making sure getting your client check-ins done and so on. So this kind of extensive and my biggest bottleneck right now, honestly, is just having a good personal assistant there to do the things that I do that I shouldn't be doing. I actually like doing some of things like the booking of my flights, my travel we talked about. This is, you know, I need that person and I just kind of selective I spend my time with, as you know, so work in progress. I usually do it every year. And so I'm going through goal setting process. So I have a process that I've perfected over the last few years, but I constantly try to perfected so doing that. And that's actually going to be available this year for the first time to everyone who signs up for our physique coaching, because I think it's so important that you set physicals, life goals, relationship goals. That's going to be available within the coaching platform as well. So I go through that and I reflect on the year and see what I've accomplished because I think that's a huge piece. So there's basically three pieces. There's the big picture. So you're twenty five year plan.

Ben Pakulski: What's your legacy? You know, if I were to die in twenty five years, how do I want to be known? Who's going to talk about me at my funeral? Are they going to say really clear on that? This is powerful. And then, you know, setting a 12 month goals and then setting three month goals or three month action plans for me more accurately and then reflecting on the past year. Just so you can celebrate. Right. Because sometimes it's hard to acknowledge how far we've come. One thing I do, if anyone's an entrepreneur. You get this, you probably get it on my computer and on my phone. I have notes. So those rumsey slinked. And so I make endless notes on it. Whether I'm learning, if I'm reading, every book I've read has notes within the notes section, every course I take, every time I've a conversation, a podcast, it's pages and pages, notes. So at the end of the year, which is this time, I go through all those notes and I organize them into files. But I also delete the ones that I've kind of taken action on. And going through them is important because it allows me one get rid of all the kind of old stuff. It's occupying space on my computer and in my brain, but also to just kind of celebrate. Oh, you know, I have all my to do list from every month I created you to do list or like kind of action item list. And I look at all of those and I reflect and I go, well, this is not so much this year. Right. And sometimes it doesn't show in the balance sheet, doesn't only show in the bank account. Right.

Ben Pakulski: But if you look back, you go, holy shit, I've done a lot. It's fun. You know, it's fun to do that and look back and acknowledge your progress as a human being. For me, as a dad, as a businessman.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah, I keep so many notes in my I'm looking at it right now. I've got a stuff to talk to Ben about. Notes. I've got food notes. Every city that I go to regularly. So we're talking to Ottawa, Toronto, New York. I have a note for all the restaurants and places I want to go eat. I have a bucket list books I've read. I know how to present. Every year I keep a list of all the books that I've read. And then the ongoing books that I want to read. Podcast stuff. Yeah. More stuff to make fun of. Bad about. Like the list goes on. There's a lot of lists there, but I think that's important. It is important to write things down because you know, the stuff that can fall by the wayside. You don't let that happen. OK.

Ashleigh VanHouten: So I have a question for you, though, going back to your physique program and there's a specific physique question, conversation that I want to have based on something you just posted on social media. And that is the small waist thing that everybody's chasing in bodybuilding. And I just want to make a note here before we go any further that I downloaded your quads and cabs program. And it turns out the fun fact I texted you the other day that your calves at their biggest were the same size as my waist at my smallest. So that's quite impressive for both of us, I think. Really?

Ben Pakulski: Yeah, I put in there that there were 22 inches and those consistently look at the base that were actually just about twenty three. I didn't put that in there because it sounds almost seen, but it consistently pointed to and then toward the end of my career, they said, man, now they've downsized a lot. And even toward the end of my career as discussed training, which was a huge mistake, by the way, for anybody listening who is inspiring physique, athlete or body builder, if anyone ever gives you the advice to stop treating a body part because it's too big.

Ben Pakulski: Kick them in the nuts because it's the dumbest thing I've ever done. Here's why both of them tore. What are they? Both there wouldn't train them for a year. And when it came down to doing superheavy leg presses to try to build my quads, well, guess what's involved? And you like press that you don't realize it's your CEFs. So when I was doing really heavy leg press, I don't even remember how it happened, but both of my calves tore separate occasions. Exact same spot because I lost the mobility. So training them, you know, obviously has the benefit of hypertrophy, but it also has the benefit of maintaining strength in the ranges of motion, your training.

Ben Pakulski: So by not training in those ranges, I lost the ability to go to those range. So I lost what's called dawsey flexion. So it doesn't know what that is. It's just basically pulling your toes to your shin and it lost it. So I go into a deep squat or deep leg press. Guess what? What you need or even what you need? Dorsi flexion. So I was exceeding my body's ability to dawsey flex in both of the calves at some time. But. Denef Bruising, what I had was extreme dogs, but guess what? Had extreme dums anytime I did a limit for quads or caps because I'd never trained them. So I determined to see even just a little bit ahead, extreme dom. So when it tore, I guess it didn't associate like, oh, it's torn. It was just it felt like it was just sore from training, which is, again, I won't throw anyone under the bus. Told me that bad advice, but don't ever do that. And even if it's decreasing the frequency or decreasing the volume or the intensity, you still train that body because the body's integrated system. If you have a massive arms, you stop trying your arms. I guarantee you begging for shoulder problems because you don't realize you're no longer do your best to address it. Crosses over the shoulder joints or the primary stay was the shoulder joint, right? Oh, am I going to trade arms because of two big shots? I'm not going to trade anything is just a bad idea.

Ashleigh VanHouten: All right. So going past your freak calves, let's talk again about small waist and how to train for that. Is it about just making other things appear bigger? So how do you train for a small waist?

Ben Pakulski: Sure. So like everybody else on the planet. I wanted to be the biggest guy in the world. And I didn't just want to be the biggest guy to my gym or my country like I wanted to win Mr. Libya. So to do that, I was comparing myself against other people. Right. Really? My career was well enough. I met as good as Flex Wheeler. I'm shit like a little sturtz. And when I'm 60 years old, man, you get so big. Good for you. It was like, nah man, until I look at this, I'm nothing. And that was my mindset. So as it progressed through my body and career, there was still this conscious, maybe even unconscious endeavor to get bigger and bigger and bigger. And what people don't realize. I have a large structure, right when you hit a certain body weight. There's a huge amount of calories that need to be consumed. So on an average day in my offseason, I was consuming six to seven thousand calories average. So typically about a thousand calories per meal, six, seven meals a day. Some of that is liquid, some solid. I learned a lot of strategies to consume more calories with less overall food. So if you're eating oatmeal or something and you're eating it really, really dry, you put a whole bunch of water in there that you really, really fully can't get calories in.

Ben Pakulski: So then you're taking a lot of digestive enzyme, taking a lot of hydrochloric acid things to optimize digestion, not consuming a lot of solid foods, you and your workout, etc., etc. But if you're consuming a lot of calories so your stomach is effectively always full. The jokes often made when I was competing was you have to train to failure and eat failure, which is not an exaggeration like this eating until you can't eat. You develop kind of an aversion to eating because doing it so much. Point being, do that for 15 years. Guess we're just always going to look like it's going to be bloated. I don't care who you are. So if you're two hundred and twelve pound bodybuilder, that's a completely different physique than someone who's walking around at 300 pounds competing at 285.

Ben Pakulski: Right. So at 285 I have to eat a shitload of calories even when I'm dieting to sustain my muscle. So there's constantly this full stomach feeling. Right. Well how do you feel after Thanksgiving dinner measurement Thanksgiving dinner six times a day for 50 years. So you're just like I don't want to eat anymore. I don't want to do it. But, you know, if you don't, do you lose muscle weight? At least that was the belief at the time. So it's just constant, constant cause your stomach is always full and bloated. Guess what happened to your ability to control that muscle? You lose it. You start stretching out your transverse abdominal and all kind of the internal musculature. You see a lot of guys getting that diced asthis, direct dye, which is like a split in the middle of the abdominals. That's what that's from just from eating too much of being bloated. If I'm trying to maintain this much muscle grows my muscle, that's a necessity. How do I get around that? It's almost a possibility, right.

Ben Pakulski: So during the end of my career, I get point being my waist got bigger than I ever wanted to be. And I even didn't like the way I looked like man like a massively shredded and my stomach hanging out ever was asked. GHW do it. Ever fucking use any stash of analogy? I won't say that I didn't, but it wasn't like some of these other guys who had a small waist, like some guys are using high numbers of substances relative to everybody else.

Ben Pakulski: I was always relatively conservative by certain they'd all admit it had my moments, but there's also the concern, particularly with things that I knew were going to build my ways because I was so conscious of my waist, so I didn't think so. My last year I said, listen, I'm going to compete again. But my only goal is to make my waist the size. My looks like I want to go onstage with 33 inch quads and 33 twist. That was the goal. And I was like, let's make this happen. What's it going to take? So it was literally being absolutely conscious that I wrote this in my social posts, but it wasn't following when Instagram. Check it out and get details on this. There's three things that I think will that I know where what I did. One, it's not this order and Instagram, but this is the autopsy. And today is hasn't massively decreased the size of my meals so that I was never, ever, ever full or bloated. So decreased the size of meal significant, which meant, yes, I had to eat more often, but it's more meals. I was never full at all that were bloated. So what does that matter? Because that allowed me then 24 hours a day or when it wasn't sleeping to control my waist. So I had to gain control of those abdominal muscles that I lost control of. So obviously there was a degree of hypertrophy to the abdominal muscles. But those muscles are so thin inherently that you can have for your dominance significantly. You can still have a relatively small waist relative to your structure. Right. We'll get into that. But point being, a decrease the size of my meals comes first. So my acid test was after every meal.

Ben Pakulski: Could I? Still control my waist. Could I still now pose? Could I still hit a vacuum pose, which is effectively for people. That is taking your belly button and pulling it as far as you can into your spine. And that's really what this was. And that was always my acid test. Could I do this if I could? Then I know it had eaten inappropriate meals. I couldn't eat too much. And that was always my acid test. So relatively, I ended up eating a little bit less food. So thereby ends up coming in a little bit smaller. And I'll be completely honest. But there's two reasons I came in small. One, my substance program was significantly less and do my food was less. At that point. I had decided on this reality that I wanted to show up and look like one of the guys in the early 90s, right. When the guys who had these beautiful aesthetic flowing physiques. And I was previously known as being the big freak. They just want to bring a completely different look. So male control size your meals. That's huge for body goes less for physique and bikini athletes, but still thing. And the other two most relevant to everybody across the board. You have to gain control of your breathing. Most people in general breathe in their chest because they have a stressed breathing pattern. Right. They breathe into the upper chest and it's very panicky almost. It's never really into the belly to the diaphragm. And most athletes in the physics world think I can't breathe into my stomach. It's going to show on stage. Absolutely incorrect by breathing into your stomach, into your diaphragm, breathing down.

Ben Pakulski: So when you inhale, you breathe, your diaphragm expands down into your pelvic floor. When you exhale, it expands up and up and kind of into the rib cage.

Ben Pakulski: It's so vital to your physiology and your ability to produce stability at your trunk and spine that if you don't do it, those muscles by definition have to hypertrophy. Right. So let's say I have a 400 pound squat on my back. And I don't have that interop dominant pressure from the diaphragm expanding down into the pelvic floor. Well, what then is going to cause stability in my structure? It's my abdominals, right? So we don't have that kind of. Well, Salva internal pressure created from the diaphragm expanding down into the pelvic floor.

Ben Pakulski: I almost have to work harder. Oh, that's interesting. Guess what happens when these muscles recover? They're going to approach offi because your body's slowly going to be bent in half when you're squatting and deadlifting because you don't have the diaphragm down there to expand out into your bum walls.

Ben Pakulski: Now those muscles are going to work harder and grow. And that happens in so many bodybuilders. Second reason, if we're breathing down there for expanding the diaphragm into our pelvic floor and exhaling, letting it come way up, we're gaining control, conscious control of those muscles.

Ben Pakulski: So why does that matter? Well, when I'm on stage, my waist could have been just as big as it was in the past. But what it wasn't was ever hanging out. Right. So even fight wasn't able to reduce my waist, which I did. But if I wasn't, I still had exponentially greater control of my ability to show it. Like I could hold a vacuum and instilling not like I could, but I could still do it probably for a minute, maybe five minutes without having to ever let it go. Well, how do you do it? Well, I can do it and not hold my breath. Right now, I have this waist that looks exponentially smaller and still while breathing. Obviously, when you're holding a vacuum, not breathing in your diaphragm, but that's a skill that I learned by be able to contract and expand the diaphragm, remembering the diaphragm, a muscle. Right. So that muscles expand when you breathe in, it needs to contract. I actually think that's backwards, but it needs to relax when you exhale. Right. So once I gain control of that consciously, I can do that anytime. And now I've shrunk in the waist. Now I can learn to control the dominoes all around. There's no more bloating. There's abdominal control and there's tons of practice. And those are kind of my three points.

Ben Pakulski: So it's portion control, it's breathing and it's practice. Like you actually give a shit. Right, which is how, you know, I can't make away smart. Well, how many times a day are you practicing vacuums? How many times a day reposing? How many times a day you do unconscious, conscious, deep breathing in most people's answer, zero.

Ashleigh VanHouten: First of all, this is just like an amazing deep dive on a very specific topic that I think people are going to love because it's so rare that we get a chance to have someone like you. You just sort of give the lowdown on a very specific part or part of bodybuilding.

Ben Pakulski: Sure. I was absolutely obsessed. Like I was obsessed with that more than I was with anything else. Right. Because, like, I hated anyone ever. I mean, your stomach looks big. I fucking drove me crazy as a Cuomo body, too. I must have a big stomach. Why have I let this happen? And the reason that happens, because I was chasing other people's physique right off chasing Cairene. I was chasing big Ramji. I was chasing all these other deaths, Wolf. And I want to be as big as those guys. For me to be that big and to eat was a huge problem. One thing I'll say, notice, nowhere in that conversation did I ever say where wasthe trainer? Well, no, in that conversation.

Ben Pakulski: Don't even say I wear a belt, right? Like it's complete fucking nonsense. And I get from a marketing perspective. Everyone and his brother now has a waist trainer company and they're all selling it. Try to capitalize on it, but it's fucking bullshit. Like the only thing it's doing. If it is effective, you wear it long enough and tight enough it can reshape your ribcage. Ask yourself do I want to my rib cage to be smaller like your body was built that way for a reason. We'll get to that. There's that.

Ashleigh VanHouten: But most waist trainers aren't even doing that, right? Like. Just say this again in our typical straightforward way for the ladies in the back, because I still see so many women doing this.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Most of them are wearing sort of tight, stretchy little thing around their waist that is not in any way going to reshape the rib cage. It's doing absolutely nothing.

Ben Pakulski: It actually can lower floating ribs can move. And if you do it long enough, you'll stay that way. So now think how bad that is long term for your spine.

Ben Pakulski: Right. You're moving this bloating ribs that are connected to your spine. That's a huge problem, right? Huge, huge truck. And it was no point.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I think waist trainers are so dumb.

Ben Pakulski: They're really stupid. But fearless is sort of what they do. Do they do compress your organs temporarily? Right. So when I'm training and I leave these things on people these days, on four days, they wake up, we go. Always looks more absolute. You're literally compressing your organs, shunting blood away from that, just like you were doing some blood flow, restricted your arms. You're kind of restricting everything in their blood flow gets taken away from that area and sent to other places. So, of course, while you're wearing a screamer or a waste trainer for 12 to 24 hours or at any time, it's going to shunt float away from that area. So that's going to cause temporary changes. But as far as long term changes, the only way to do it is to change your ability to control or atrophy those muscles and maybe waste trainers could potentially atrophy muscles. But I don't think anybody wants to ask for the muscles because they've probably three humans in my life who actually have a significantly Purchas feed abdominal wall like some top Byblos do. That's because the breathing is poor. Right. Did that make sense when I explained why the diaphragm is so important and trunk's stability like this diaphragm supposed to expand down into my pelvic floor.

Ben Pakulski: And most people don't do that. They have such shallow breath patterns that they never it was brought up in the chest. Note that their abdominals, particularly the Brexit bonus extra obliques, are asked to exponentially more work when it comes to spinal loading. When I go into a squatter deadlift or really any exercise, I don't have that internal pressure to that's supposed to be the primary stabilizer of my trunk and spine. So now my body has to exponentially increase the firing rate of the muscles.

Ben Pakulski: That's what makes those things grow. And so again, what a waste trying to help that. Not in any way. That's going to be significant. Internal stimulus is always gonna be stronger than an external one. Right. Your breathing is going to be better for improving your back mobility, shoulder mobility than stretching or than any massage ever could, because it's an internal signal that signals your nervous system creates a hormonal cascade and enzymatic response that causes an internal change rather than me jamming my elbow into something.

Ben Pakulski: I actually have my body, my nervous system and the endocrine system. So a tissue length you need to change rather than hey, just go, Jen, that crew, that cross-border or foam roller into your body part.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Ok. I have another question about waist size. And this is about exercises. I can speak for myself as a figure competitor.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I naturally have very small waist. That was kind of just a lucky genetic thing that I had going into competing. But I also came from CrossFit background and powerlifting background where I won't judge you for it. Yeah, I know. Well, you can if you want. It's kind of funny, but I learned a lot from all of these things.

Ashleigh VanHouten: But I do come at this from I want aesthetics, but I also want functional fitness that is good for my body and movement and for being strong. So I always cared about this breathing, this stability and this ability to brace all of these things for lifting. But I also did not want to add any size to my waist whatsoever. Right. As a figure competitor specifically, you really want to have that nice v taper in the small waist. And so I never did any extra kind of like oblique stuff for like crazy heavy abs, stuff. Like, I literally was just like I'm doing deadlifts and like Pull-Ups and like some planks and stuff. My abs are pretty good when I'm laying it like it is what it is. But are there are exercises that you can do, like core strength exercises that are going to help tighten that area. And conversely, if you look at a lot of CrossFit areas, especially and this isn't a judgment call, it's a sport specific kind of body type. A lot of these cross fighters have big, thick, muscular, wide trunks and midsection. And you got to believe that it's from these crazy, heavy, high volume, high weight cleans and deadlifts and all this stuff that they're doing. So are there exercises that you could be doing that you think is just strengthen your abs and making you stronger, but is actually widening your midsection as well?

Ben Pakulski: So if you were done, I'm going to guess the answer's no. But I'm asking you is, have you ever done a cadaveric course?

Ashleigh VanHouten: That's an awesome question. No, I haven't. But I'll add it to my 20:20 list of goals.

Ben Pakulski: You know what we'll do together.

Ben Pakulski: So if you look at the actual thickness of the abdominal wall in a really, well, muscular person, so like me, during my peak, the thickness of the rectus abdominals may have been half an inch or so, maybe three korten.

Ben Pakulski: That wouldn't be three quarters of an inch, much less than three quarters of my greatest level of hyper treat, the thickness of my belt. The wall was probably three quarters half an inch to three quarters of that.

Ben Pakulski: So to add any amount of her poetry to that is going to be so insignificant to the actual circumference of your waist that it wouldn't be noticeable. The only way I would suggest you could add is if it was significant. Lee. Intentional loading those strawmen. If I was a power lifter, I'd want to make my trunk like a fire hydrant, so I'd be doing things like really, really heavy, loaded side bends and things like really, really heavy loaded into extension type exercises. But we have to be so heavy, so frequent and so hard edge that no human being, no professional body builder, no physique athlete does it anywhere near that. So if my subdominant was three quarters of, let's say, just arbitrary three course age in order to see a significant change, I'm going to have to double that as far as the actual size of my waist. Right. So let's add three quarters of an inch to my waist of actual hypertrophy. Well, how much is that going to take away from my parents? Three quarters of an age. It's nothing. It's so insignificant. You. You probably had know certainly less than maybe a quarter of an inch of abdominal thickness, maybe a little bit more than that, but not very much so. It's so insignificant that people are confused as to what contribution it's actually make. Yes, very little. I won't say nothing, but very little to do with the size of your waist, like the actual hypertrophy of those muscles. So what I would suggest people do is do train those muscles because the limiting factor, your ability to produce force everywhere. So what you want to do, wear her butchery will typically happen is where movement happens, right. So it's going to deadlift. And we've all seen people who kind of round their back at a particular spot in their spine deadlift. That particular segment of the spine, the muscles that surround it are going to amperage most. So when there's movement.

Ben Pakulski: It's because let's say I'm trying to deadlift and trying to maintain spinal eccentrically some neutral spine. And I go through deadlift at some point and to lift the weights that heavy, my spine starts around a little bit.

Ben Pakulski: I've actually gone through an eccentric loading or concentric loading of that particular area of the spine. That's where it's going to happen. So that's what's going to happen with your waist if you're doing squats or deadlift or something, if there's a particular aspect, your waist that tends to cave to break because it's the weakness that will be the point that would tend to push free more. So point being, if we create stability at all lengths of this contract out range, so lengthen mid range, shorten contractions of all the abdominal muscles and they're relatively equally balanced and their ability to maintain spinal extension or prevent spinal extension.

Ben Pakulski: The likelihood of hypertrophy is effectively zero like at any significant amount unless you're really, really consciously trying to do it like I'm talking leg date type training to try to do it right. Like how do you. Bojo It's ash. Is it easy like you do like a few six to 10 sets, moderate weight is going to build it? No, but it could certainly make it more dense potentially. Right. So it's not going to add a significant amount of retreat. And it was this along kind of tangent to talk with it.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Now, I think this is super, super cool. We haven't really covered this stuff before, so I really appreciate it. One last question. You talked about AB separation, right? That occurs with a lot of these Eggar bodybuilders. Yeah. And like women, of course. No, it more commonly from pregnancy. Right. It's a thing that happens to a lot of women because they're getting big bellies, too. For other reasons. But what are some ways that you personally or that, you know, in the bodybuilding world that bodybuilders can work to fix that problem while still being big? It's still lifting and still working hard?

Ben Pakulski: Well, I don't know that you can fix it, but I think the solution is training your dominance. Right. So if I'm getting too big and my waist is growing, my ability to control my abdominals goes out the window and those muscles just lengthen and stretch.

Ben Pakulski: So once you've got it, I can't say it can't, but I won't say that you can't change it. So the trick is prevention. Right. If I trim abdominals every day, I'm just effectively making those muscles stronger. Kind of like hernias, right? Hernia. So just like a defect in the muscle that sometimes causes a bit of a tear of the abdominals. But so if I have strong muscles that are strong from the entire length of contract all training, the likelihood of that stuff happening becomes severely lessened. The biggest mistake bodybuilders make is not treating their bumps. I'm looking for my job as the offseason. Okay. Tell me how many hernias you get to up with. Right. There's a lot of body was good hernias or good diocese's distressed. Correct? It's just not a good idea to not train like me with my caps.

Ben Pakulski: Great podcasts, love chatting about the stuff. I think people will appreciate perspective on weight trainers and actually what is actually necessary. I think it's human nature that we want to have an easy path through hell. If I could just wrap this thing around my waist, it means it's going to make my way smaller.

Ben Pakulski: No, no, no. I didn't talk a lot about this, but I was obsessed. Now you know me, right? I was really ridiculously obsessed with being a great bodybuilder. And so I thought about constantly walking around with my shirt off at that time to make sure that I always had my stomach pulled in or I was always never letting it fall out. But hopefully people value this guy. If he did, we'd appreciate you guys shirts, podcasts for at least one person you love. This is the most intelligent Q&A brought to you today by Chile Pad.
