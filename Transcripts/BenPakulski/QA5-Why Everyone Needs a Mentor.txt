QA5-Why everyone needs a mentor

Ben Pakulski: Hey everybody, welcome the Muscle Intelligence Podcast Q&A edition. I'm here with my amazing, wonderful, beautiful and jacked cohost Ashleigh VanHouten.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Can we stop right there? Quit while we're ahead? That made my day. OK, good.

Ben Pakulski: It's over.

Ashleigh VanHouten: It's funny, though, because I actually first of all, thank you very much.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I'm happy to be here, as I always am. But you may I don't know if you've seen because you're in beautiful Colombia and have better things to do than be on social media. But I did just post in my stories today just some sort of gratitude about working with you on this podcast, co-hosting with you and how unique I think it is that not that we're the only people doing this, but that we're co-hosting. And it's two different people, different genders. That's where I'm getting at. We've got a guy and a girl coming at the same topic from different sort of perspectives and angles. And it's more unique than probably it should be. Right. Like I listen to a lot of fitness podcasts and I listened to ones where it's just two or three dudes talking about lifting, where it's women talking about women's health. And it seems like it's so much more rare to have just a guy and a girl talking about these subjects like it has to be gendered for some reason. Like, Here's the girl podcast about health. Here's the dude podcast about health. And I just I appreciate so much that we can kind of open it up and include everybody, I think, in these conversations anyway. So that's my kind of rant to the day. But I just I'm happy to be here and I'm glad that we're doing.

Ben Pakulski: I'm super grateful to have you, honestly. And that was really kind of the intention. Right. I hate the idea. And you know me by now. I hate the idea of being dogmatic. And people just tend to get stuck in these camps of like, you know, we have to stick with all guys and longer these meta lifting or we all go to powerlifting or organic bodybuilding.

Ben Pakulski: We're all going to be in this very, very specific camp. And I think that's useful. I think that could be useful to kind of take one path and run with it. But, you know, my evolution has been have been there and I've done that. And I was dogmatic about things for a long time. And now you realize that's not what people need. Like people need to have knowledge and a skill set to make their own decisions. And they don't need a dogmatic cheerleader telling them, hey, look at me, follow me. This is the way to go. They need somebody going, hey, man, in amidst all this bullshit that exists in the world, here's how to make decisions based on how you feel right now and what your goal is right now. And I think that's why you and I are a great complement because you're not overly dogmatic about anything. And I certainly try to not be. And we just kind of give the science, we give some opinions and we just provide entertainment value.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. You're the funny one. I'm like strictly business guy. You know what I mean? Also, like, realistically, we all love to consume content that is in line with our current values and goals and what we're into. But nobody learns when you're only surrounding yourself with people who are exactly like you. It's ridiculous to do that. I get that it's comfortable. But you talk about this all the time, that it's important to be out of your comfort zone and to push yourself and challenge yourself. And it just seems silly to only kind of keep trying to double down on the things you already think, you know, like let's open it up to to new opinions and new experiences and different perspectives. Like that's how you learn and grow.

Ashleigh VanHouten: So, I mean, anyway... 

Ben Pakulski: Yeah, I heard a really good story this morning about perspective on adversity.

Ben Pakulski: Right. And we all face adversity in varying degrees and some people who face really, really bad stuff and stuff that some of us cannot fathom. And again, it comes back to Victor Frankl and that's the best book is like it's always, always, always your choice. And sometimes even in your darkest hour, when you think the world is against you, maybe you should attempt or focus on seeing how much stronger you're going to come out on the other side. People that message me all the time and like, I'm really struggling right now and your words are encouraging me. And that's why I'm here, is because I've been through some dark shit and I was blessed as a seven year old and a nine year old and a twelve year old to have some really challenging encounters, really challenging life experiences that allowed me to stand there unshaken and go, okay. I got this at the time I didn't know, but you know, how much it would make me resilient to the challenges in the world. And I don't claim to be the strongest guidance from the people that they have been through things that are much higher than me. But I think that's what allows me to give perspective. And so rather than crumbling under hard situations, we welcome them. And, you know, life shouldn't be easy. Like the worst fucking thing in the world, you know, and it's for life to be easy. And people always want these stresses to go away. You don't. You want to get better. You know, Jim Rohn, which is probably my earliest mentors in this space, said never ask for life to be easier. Ask for yourself to be better. And that to me just resonated in my head and is honestly a perfect Segway. And I'm going to talk about today, because that quote itself and the discovery of Jim Rome came from the man that we're going to talk about today. And you know, my friends.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. That's what we talked about. off-line. I said I would love for you to talk more about this first mentor that you had. You posted about it on social media, because it's the first I've seen of him. And I actually went down a little rabbit hole and did some research. And once I saw that, you posted it. But and this goes along, too, with one of the success principles that you talk about that I wanted you to talk about more, which is the importance of. Hiring a coach, whether it's in life or for a specific goal. But yeah. Tell us a little bit about who this guy is.

Ben Pakulski: So. Twenty seven years old, I was inspiring. A bodybuilder had actually just gotten a pro card. So maybe see before twenty seven point twenty five. And I was an aspiring bodybuilder and.

Ben Pakulski: Had no idea. Like, you don't know what you know. Right. I just figured, like, all I do is eat, sleep and train, just like most young bodybuilders.

Ben Pakulski: And I found this guy literally. I feel like he was an angel to me because I found him by accident. I went to him for manual therapy. He was an osteopath. And I'd go to him because he made my knees feel better. It made my shoulder feel better, my elbows or something. It is amazing, my therapist. But the side benefit that I received and what ended up really making me go back. Time and time again and driving for an hour, once or twice a week was the talks we had. And he started getting in my head about how to become a better man and how to become a leader. And how it started for me and him was he'd ask me how my week was going to complain and complain about my girlfriend at the time and complain about my dad, complain about, you know, whatever at that house I was complaining about. But those two stand up my mind.

Ben Pakulski: And, you know, there's two scenarios that he really, really mentored me on that kind of started off our relationship was this girl that I was with at the time was a massive stress to me. Like she caused a lot of issues for me. She was wonderful person. But the time probably a lot of stress. And, you know, I played a victim. I was like, you know, blaming her and saying she's this and she's that. And he just would. Every single time check me on my words and on my choice of victim language and just being a victim. So there's two things that he did in that situation. Every time I would walk into his office, he would always stop me and check me on the words that came out of my mouth. I have to. I can't. Things like this. Right. Or, you know, just ultimately framing myself as a victim. And anytime the situation with this girl came out, piece of him. And so why are you choosing to be there? Why did you choose to bring this into your life? What do you need to know? And at the time, I was like with al-Aziz, get talking. So it was mine. And then he just started to kind of slowly, I guess, indoctrinate my unconscious mind into this reality and kind of staring me down the path of understanding that I created this. I chose to bring these things into my life because there's something I need to learn. I choose these victim words and allow myself to be the victim. So Alvin Brown is the guy we're talking about, and he's a amazing, wonderful man out of Canada who is now just finally starting to come online and grow his online coaching. Up to now, he's for kids. He's got two success businesses. He's got a wife now. Gosh, I think 30 years, maybe longer.

Ben Pakulski: They've been get together since he was 14. Never had anybody else.

Ashleigh VanHouten: That's a whole other topic of conversation.

Ben Pakulski: Well, listen, So I value that stuff, right.

Ben Pakulski: I value people who have integrity and say, like, you know, the conversation we have all the time spent. Cheating is easy. Cheating is easy, man. Like it doesn't take a strong man to go out and pick up some girl and have sex with them. That's easy. What's hard is being faithful to the person you made a commitment to. So that's hard. So if you want to be a strong man, you be faithful to that person you made a commitment to. And that's powerful to me. And he always hit home and that's him. And I get along get along really well like him. If you make a commitment, no matter what it is, you fucking follow through. And even if you don't want to and I say this to everyone who starts coaching with me, it's like if we do decide to coach for six months and you decide at three months that this isn't for you, I really care. Like we're gonna stay with this. I'll give you your money back. Well, you're going to fucking follow through your commitment because nobody's ever done this. But this is always the conversation is like you made a commitment to stick through this and you know, your unconscious mind knows your character, your integrity is standing behind this. And now I've talked about this in the past as before with you, is integrity in life to yourself?

Ben Pakulski: Is everything?

Ben Pakulski: Everything, everything. And I can't overstate how many times that's come back to slap me in the face and go, hey, you said this, you do this and I'm still not perfect. It's still like rips my heart out when I do some or when I say something and I don't pull through. But it's a massive thing. So these are things you start to teach me and, you know, we go in there, we spend our together. And it started off with three things that I want everyone to kind of acknowledge that if you don't have this in your life, find a friend, find a coach, find a mentor, because this will change your life.

Ben Pakulski: It's the words you use because the words you use are a reflection of your unconscious mind. You don't think about the words used. In most cases, they become unconscious in their reflection of what you believe your unconscious mind. So are you a victim? Are you taking responsibility for your life? And second one that leads in perfectly is never, ever, ever be a victim. So that means taking extreme ownership for everything in your life. I am completely responsible for everything I do. Responsible I say I'm responsible for my own financial situation, for the way my body looks for everything. And if you could take responsibility for that and powers you owe so much to take control on the responsible is someone else's fault or I'm a victim in this circumstance. You backing yourself into a corner and losing all your power, you're literally handing away your power. And the third thing. So it's the words you use the victim versus responsible. Like being very responsible for should life. And the third one is having your growth mindset. Meaning absolutely nothing in your life is fixed. You are not born with anything other than a blueprint for life. If you want to change your body, you want to change your brain. If you change your business, you won't change your ability to communicate. You speak every one of those things is within your power. And that's a growth mindset. And those are the three things I think that I learned above all, in the first two to three years of my relationship with Alvin and Alvin and I have been friends for 20 years now of those fifteen years now.

Ben Pakulski: And we don't talk often enough because we're both busy and we're not the same city all the time. But when we do, it's like, you know, it's my brother that I haven't seen in a couple weeks. And it's like we just pick up where we left off. And so many lessons to be learned in there. And I can make some suggestions on the books that he suggested to me, like the early books that really shifted my psyche away from being this victim, this wandering, meandering method to someone who started becoming aware of everything.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I have a few kind of tactical questions about coaches and mentors that I want to ask you about. But I first I just want to double down on something you said because I think it's so important. And none of us can hear it enough. And we've talked about it on the podcast before. But it's that not allowing yourself to be a victim. And what you said about how it's a lot of responsibility that you're taking on for yourself. But it's also incredibly empowering and freeing to know that you have the choice to be a victim or not. And I was listening to another podcast with a different bodybuilder. She was talking about her experiences and going through professional bodybuilding. And she was saying, like, I caught myself complaining about the food that I had to eat and what I had to do to have a six pack. And then I was like, why am I being such a bitch? Like, I chose this. It's forcing me to have a six pack. Like, what kind of person chooses to do something for themselves? Because we all know bodybuilding is a pretty you know, it's a selfish sport in a lot of ways. And then you complain about having to do it. I mean, it's silly. So I think just checking yourself daily and that's another one of your principles, I think was like this kind of constant check in with yourself, like, how are you talking to yourself? How are you talking to other people? What are your goals? And if your goals change, you don't want to do this anymore. That's not the same as giving up. But you need to just constantly be aware that you have a choice every day to do the thing you said you were going to do or not. You have to live with it. You know, if you do or you don't. I think that's really important to just.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah. You know, when I say like you have to see through, it's absolutely always OK. Right. Lateral shift. Right. So I was like, well, I don't really want to do that anymore.

Ben Pakulski: Go this direction, do something different, but you're still going to pursue some goals voraciously. So one thing when I ask you is how do you feel about women enabling each other? And again. Well, I'm going to speak ask you this question a little. Specifically, I see this a lot and actually drives me crazy where women enable each other to be victims. And it drives me insane. And then it's like this women's empowerment, whether they frame it as this women's empowerment thing like. But it's completely just enabling a victims mentality. And I don't wanna come across as insensitive person, but I see it all the time. And I'm just like, how can you not see this? Yeah. Like, you're just enabling the victim attitude, the victim mentality. But they think it's an empowerment thing. And, you know, you're bright enough to see that. And how do you feel about.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. I mean, I think this is like a big topic for sure.

Ashleigh VanHouten: And I mean, I think that in the context of like the greater culture that we're dealing with right now, which is very hypersensitive and hyper political and sort of everybody has to take a stance on everything rather than sometimes maybe just kind of observing and taking things and moving on. We all feel like we kind of have to have our say or have our two cents or express our feelings about every single thing that happens, which hasn't always been the case in history. And so, of course, as a woman, I feel like there are certain elements to this new kind of cultural shift that are positive for women in a way where they feel like they can express their emotions and express how they feel about things that they perceive as injustice and all of that stuff. And I think everyone should feel like they have a voice, no matter who you are or where you come from. I like similar to you and I don't think this is necessarily gendered. I grew up being taught and not necessarily explicitly taught, but taught through my experiences that you have to take care of yourself and that no one else is really going to do it for you ultimately. And so you have to be able to, you know, pull up your own bootstraps and like be competent and be able to stand up for yourself and take care of yourself. So I've never bought into that whole victim thing. And I think we've have this conversation, too. It may almost be like sort of a character flaw on my part that I feel like any kind of admission of weakness or like something's wrong or like I need help with something I perceive as weakness.

Ashleigh VanHouten: And I'm extra sensitive to it because I'm a woman and I feel like people are going to be quick to perceive me as weak if I let my guard down at all. So I'm almost on the opposite side of this kind of whole debate. But I will say for my part, rather than trying to get like too deeply enmeshed in it and get into the politics and all the sensitivities around it. What I tend to do is when I'm dealing with women in my personal life and that can be women who are reaching out to me on social media, asking questions about being intimidated to go to the gym or people are kind of treating the badly in this situation, that situation or when I have girlfriends who are struggling with things, I kind of just talk to them the way you talk to me and the way you talk to your community and your listeners. And instead of sort of encouraging any kind of negativity or victim mindset, you. Immediately go to where they have choice, where they have power, what they can do to move on from whatever is happening and just what are the next steps like, let's be logical. Let's be tactical. What's your bullshit situation? OK. Instead of just kind of being mired down in that, let's look at how we get out of it. And so that's kind of my personal approach. Like I think it's easy to be. Roll your eyes and be irritated by what we're seeing on social media or whatever. And it's just like just do what you can with your immediate community and just try to preach that positivity and the, you know, common sense that you feel.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah. With respect to this whole like helping each other and coaching thing. I think the biggest thing that I wish someone would a slap me in the face for when I was starting this and probably when I was a kid is the biggest thing holding you back from progressing is what you think you know. And I think it's very hard as a human being to empower another human being, whether it be a coach or a mentor or friend with complete authority to tell you that you're being an idiot. So here's an example. Like when I was coming up through bodybuilding, you know, I put on a decent amount of muscle in my early career or my early years. And then I had this guy come through and he said, hey, man, why don't you try it this way? And I knew he was right. But I was so touched to what it was that got me there. It was very hard for me to let go of what I'd done to get there. So I didn't. And it took me exponentially longer to get a result. Whereas if you you know, same thing in any type of coaching. Right. If you're doing something that's kind of early work and you're not really sure like to give somebody else enough power and trust to take their word and actually run with it wholeheartedly.

Ben Pakulski: It's really, really challenging because there's potentially a lot of downside of pinch, a lot of pain. But that's exactly the very thing holding you back. So when I started working with Alvin, I would have just listened to everything he said and did it and went all in. I would be exponentially further ahead in my life than I am right now. But it didn't. And you know, for whatever reason, that was my path. And I had a lot to learn and I did. And I've been through some challenges because of it. But, you know, that's my advice to people is like if you find someone that you trust and you find some of that, you know, this person has your best interests at heart, commit full fledge like wholeheartedly, get into it. So there's a flip side to this. Maybe the people that listen to this podcast are coaches, people or people who are interested in growing their online business. People who are coaching people. JM People who are life coaches, etc. So as a coach, the first thing that you must do is let your client know that you care about them.

Ben Pakulski: You have no ulterior motive if you have no other vested interests. The only thing I want is for you to succeed. And it has to come from an altruistic place, a selfless place of like a sincere desire to help. That's what I do with my clients and that's why my clients have such great buy. It is because they know I have no ulterior motive. If I tell you something, it's because I care about your best interests. And that's the hardest thing for any coach to do, because most people come into a coaching and client relationship and the client senses some type of insecurity in the coach or the sense of type of ulterior motive. Like, I don't know if this guy is talking about this girl knows she's my best interest at heart. If you have that, you might as well. And the relationship, you have to find someone who, you know, without a shadow of a doubt is completely invested in your success. And if you do, you're going to win and you're going to win fast and big, provided the person who you trust is actually has your best interests at heart and knows what they're talking about. So there's two sides of that coin, right? Is just buying it.

Ben Pakulski: Like if you're gonna invest in somebody, you must believe that they have your best interests at heart. And if you're a coach, that must be your first intent. Like, forget about all the X's and O's, all the tactics of coaching, getting physique changes, getting business growth is so fucking nonsense. Mean it's useful, but it's not the first step. The first step is always getting people to know you and trust you. And there's a great book on this topic for anyone who's a coach. There's called Trillion-Dollar Coach by Eric Schwartz from Google. It's about his mentor who really shifted his life and Steve Jobs his life. He was the mentor to both of those two guys. And it gives Bill something is escaping me right now. But that would be a great book to read. And I really get a lot of that book. And the reason I said Bill was such a big influence on their life is because he was able to say absolutely anything to them, including extreme cuss words and all these things that nobody else would ever say it in a boardroom at Google or Apple. But Bill would walk in and say whatever he wanted because everyone knew that he had every single person's best interest at heart.

Ben Pakulski: So he could say anything to you, like, why are you being such an idiot, stopping an asshole, whatever. Like get your head into your ass. Louis, these are like quotes from the book. And then he would say, here's what you need to do next and take that action. And everyone did. And that's why it succeeded. And they literally credit this guy for a huge part of their success. I'm not saying everyone needs to be able to use cuss words, but I'm saying the reason he was able to do that stuff and say the things that he needs to say without any negative tension is because he actually cared for these people. That's a huge, huge part of coaching. And that's what another reason why I loved Alvin, because this guy, he had no reason to believe me straight. He had no reason to tell me anything other than the truth. And I saw his success and I wanted to model his success in business and relationship. And just as a human being. Like, I love people who are grounded in my grounded. I mean, they're not fluctuating. Like, you know, you're great for this ashes, like you're not an overly emotional person.

Ben Pakulski: Meaning like if something pisses you off, you're going to show it, but you're not going to fly off the handle or if the baby under emotional cases like a whole relationship issue that we could talk about in another. But anyway. Yes, but consistency, right.

Ben Pakulski: Consistency like I value that so much because I grew up with the opposite. Right. I grew up with people who were just volatile. And I hate volatility.

Ben Pakulski: Like, hey, when we really, really happy one minute and then the next minute we're gonna be off the change. Crazy. And then you talk. Yeah. Me being sometimes too serious and stoic. But that's what I value and human being. I value consistency. But I want you to be predictable and I can depend on you and you have integrity. And that's the shit that I value to him being. I think that maybe the most important human characteristic to me.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. I mean, there's nothing more stressful. And not knowing what you're going to get with somebody who you've invested in strongly, whether it's a relationship or a family member or a coach or anybody. Yeah. That's awful. I want to ask you a question, though, about I'd like you to talk about the differences and maybe the similarities, whatever, between a coach and a mentor. Because those are two possibly different relationships that can accomplish different things. I know that you've been that both of those two people and you've had both of those. So can we talk a little bit about sort of the the differences and maybe somebody who's looking for someone and they're not sure who or what which avenue they should go down? You know, if you could kind of get into that.

Ben Pakulski: So I think coach is very tactical. I think it's very much like X's and O's, like, you know, speak that. That's very American football terminology. It's like we're going about there. We're going to tell you how to get from point A to point B. You don't take your business from hundred thousand to a million. Here's how to do it. We get to build the funnel. We're gonna quali is we gonna do sales? It's very, very tactical. There's no emotion. There's no life coaching. There's no mentorship leadership like that. Just like here's the tactics. You know, that's a coach. I believe that's it's very tactical. And a mentor is someone who you want to emulate, someone who, you know, hey, I mean, I'm going to take you into my wing and teach you everything I know about life, about finances, about relationships, about business, and just becoming not only a successful business person or having a successful body, but ultimately loving your life. And I think that's how I view a mentor as someone who I aspire to be more like in some aspect of life. I had a great call with my mentor last night and my current mentor. And, you know, again, I don't even know if he knows I call my mentor, but he is. And any time I need anything thought through, he's my God. I'm like, I'm gonna get a phone. This guy came in to talk with us. Like, how do I come negotiate with this?

Ben Pakulski: And what I value in him is this stoic, logical look at everything from all sides perspective. Never just like we're going to rush into something. There's no emotion. Like, I tend to get excited about things like I wanna work fast in this business. I'm going to push hard on this. I got to jump on this with an investment money there.

Ben Pakulski: And he goes, well, we'll hang this type of this. Why? How? Who?

Ben Pakulski: Right. And he's asking all these questions. And then at the end of it, we have all the answers and we've looked at it from all possible sides. And that to me as a mentor is someone I know I can rely on to be there for me to guide me on the hard decisions in life. That's a mentor and that's my meaning.

Ashleigh VanHouten: It seems like also, again, just from a strategic standpoint, in many cases, this is an across the board, but a coach is again somebody that's a more transactional sometimes or like you're paying for them to coach you for a specific goal usually, whereas a mentor, maybe a more like informal, like a mentorship for maybe career or life or whatever. But it tends to be maybe a little bit less transactional sometimes as I.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah, I still pay for mentorship, but I like that to me is the most valuable thing in the world. Like if I look at the end of the day, who gives a shit if you make a hundred million dollar business, if you're still an asshole and hate yourself, right. If you hate your life for sure, that's all. Put that one on the t shirt. Right. Like ultimately I know many people who are multi hundred million dollars and they said they could promote good friends. Call me Benny.

Ben Pakulski: They said that I would change lives of you in a second and I go dude I wouldn't change life to you and for anything like for any amount of money because they know they got to this point and they've created this stress and these anxieties and these emotional states and these dependencies and just this life that needs to be kind of broken back down, built back up from the ground up. And I think there's a lot to be learned there. And this is really where I am in my life, as you know, laying these solid foundations of honesty, of integrity and caring and love in my life and building things on top of that.

Ben Pakulski: Right. So what I don't want is to make money from a place of dishonesty and lack of integrity and conniving and, you know, ultimately not a win win for everybody. I never want to do that. So if I can do things that are great that come from the solid foundation, I know for the rest of my life, I have a settled heart and so mind that to me is way more valuable than any amount of money.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Do you have any suggestions and I have some thoughts about this myself, but I know you get asked multiple times a day about mentorship. And if you know and I know you've kind of done some of this work and you're working out a program, but if someone's looking to enlist a mentor and maybe this is not because a lot of them again, you're not necessarily. Early paying for them, sometimes you are, sometimes it's a transactional thing, like you're going to offer some value to them and they're an offer, some value back to you. But what are some recommendations you have for somebody who's listening, who wants a mentor, whether it's you or anybody else, how they should go about seeking one out, approaching one, how they should, you know, kind of frame their relationship like just kind of any kind of pragmatic steps.

Ben Pakulski: One of the hardest things I've ever done, Ash, is making the twenty five year vista. So rather than a plan, like people say said twenty three goals. It looks like.

Ben Pakulski: But it's like twenty five year vista, which is like the big picture long term view. Right. Was my life look like in 25 years? What is your funeral look like? Right. What are people saying at your funeral when you die? Who's it? Your funeral? What are they saying? Things like that. You know, not that it's 25 years in the death of the same thing, but looking like these far and term goals going, who do I want to be? I don't want to impact the world. How to want to be remembered. And looking at it from that perspective and creating a list of all those things that may exist in that context is really, really useful for how to guide your life. Right. So people set these goals like how to make a million bucks. Why write what I want to make money books. Wow. Because I think it's going to make me happier. You mean you know this and this and this. It's fucking not. It's just like muscle. Right. The thing that I've learned with muscle is you can build all the muscle in the world. It doesn't change who you are. So don't set the goal to build the muscle, set the goal for what it makes you to become. And that's another gym, Rome quote, another one of our 44 success principles.

Ben Pakulski: So that's a big thing with this mentorship thing. So once you've decided who you want to be and what it is that you want to be said about you, you know, it's your funeral or you're twenty five years when you know, if 25 years is this interesting place, because by that point, hopefully you've made enough money and you're set for life. Let's say hypothetically, you're set for life. How do you want to be remembered or what do you want to be doing when money's no longer an object and you have all the money you need? What are you doing? What gives you joy? What brings you fulfillment? How you want to be impacting the world? So once you determine those things, it becomes a little bit more self evident who you're trying to become and who would be an appropriate mentor. And there's a particular blind spot or a weakness that you're harboring. That would be probably the best place for you to start looking for a mentor. I like I'm really bad at finances. Go find a financial mentor, right? If I'm really bad at physique stuff. Go find a physique mentor. If I'm really bad at business or from really bad at relationships. Or you can have 10 mentors right in the day, you could have mentors in different areas. Ideally, you find one who kind of has all these different skills and assets. That's what Alvin was to me.

Ben Pakulski: I valued every piece of his life because that's what I value as a person. That's what I want to be. I don't want to be really good at finance and shooting at my body until we really get a good body and really shoot it in a relationship like a balanced. So when I look for a mentor, that's what I look for. Does this man or woman have integrity in business and relationships and in finance and everything? Right. So finding someone who's in alignment with your values and values is everything. So if anyone hasn't done their values yet, the value determines a strong, strong. Strongly recommend you do that with Dr. John Demartini. If you have the finances, move heaven and earth to go to one of this guy's events. I haven't yet, but I watch everything he puts out on line and all my friends go to his events because it's happened to me not be able to coordinate timing, but any time I'm ever in the right place, or if I can find the right place, I'm going to be there. He's the guy who's going to help you determine what you value and actually understand decision making and how to progressing your life. And are you on the right path for you? It's so interesting, but we think he's the guy in the world, her value determinants. But that's how you find a mentor.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Cool. There's a couple of things I want to tack on to this that again, are just very sort of like tactical, pragmatic points. And you can tell me if you agree or not. But one of them, I think, is if you are reaching out to a potential mentor and this is gonna be an informal sort of interaction, the thing that I think people need to keep in mind is and you've said this a lot actually in the podcast and just in life, I know when we're talking offline, it's always about what you can do for other people first. Right. And it's OK to want things to want help from people and to think that doing something good good's going to come back to you, because all of that is true and human nature. But you have to be approaching things with what value can I add to other people first? Because how many times even in my life, people that are in my life and friends and people who are mentors to other people, have they been approached by someone who is just like, I think you're awesome. Will you mentor me at the end? Like, you literally are reaching out to a stranger and asking them to do work for you. Like you have to think about what this interaction is, what you can offer to somebody so that you can get something in exchange. That's how this works. Like nobody owes you anything. I think a lot of us just are born with this sense that like the world should give them stuff so they can be successful. Nobody else do anything, and no one has any obligation to teach you stuff just because they can. You need to come into this with a little bit of a like, you know, give and take relationship attitude. So I think the first thing that people should think of when they're gonna send a cold email or a message or a DM or whatever is think that through before you just like tell somebody you like, hey, you're pretty cool. I want to mentor me like c'mon.

Ben Pakulski: Are you ranting because you see my inbox?

Ashleigh VanHouten:  Yeah, OK. Well, yes, your inbox, but also. And so I could be rude. So you don't have to on the podcast, but not just you like. This is something I think is pervasive.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I've had it to a lesser extent to that people literally reach out and demand things up you because you're in a place where. And look, you've said explicitly out loud to your community that you're here to help and serve people. And that's fantastic. And I like to do that, too. But there's like a reasonable limit here where it's not my job to sit and answer your intricate dams because you sent it to me like there's gotta be a little bit of understanding and respect for people's time and knowledge and expertise and that you can't. Yeah, you can't just like look, if you mentor everybody who just sent you a DMB, like, hey, you want to mentor me, like, do you want wouldn't be your doc on the podcast right now, you'd be fucking mentoring everyone. So anyway, I think just again, being reasonable, being thoughtful and respectful of other people's time I think is a big step.

Ben Pakulski: And here's the thing. Like not everyone needs to be mentored by me or I like netero needs to be mentored by. Everyone just needs to go from point A to point B. Everyone's trying to go from point A to point cute. Right. Try to jump their way through all these different hoops and you can't like. Life is a series of steps that need to be done in order. And it's very, very challenging to bypass any of these steps. So, you know, if you're ready to have a high level mentor, then approach them in a way that's appropriate. And you'll know that by the time you are ready to take on that mentor, you know, like if I'm taking out a mentor, I'm certainly not going to approach them in a way that's anything other than certain. Very good time or and very good for your time. I'd love to hire you to do this financially capable. And, you know, I want to let them know that. And I wanted to make it very professional or like, you know, if I just want to hire somebody who's gonna take me from, you know, this very, very my new thing and make my mistake, like, hey, I'd love to, you know, exchange some type of service or find some way, like you said, to have a mutually beneficial relationship. Always. It's always gonna be a win win. Never just come with your hand out. And, you know, the millennial generation tends to get a lot of slack for that.

Ben Pakulski: And I don't know that it's just millennials. I think it's, you know, a lot of people in this entitled world thing like, oh, you owe me something or, you know, it's a very materialistic world of like, you know, we're the best, we're superior and you owe me something. So why don't you just do this for me? Because I asked. And that's it's such a ridiculous new world culture that frustrates the shit out of me. Some day is like, you know, I get people who apply to work with me and they're like, I want to make this huge amount of money I've ever done anything before. I've got no experience, no skills. But I want to make a huge amount of money without ever improve themselves. And for me, like this is how I hire people like the little like the two people who are my longest term employees literally did work without me knowing and sent it to me. Go, Hey, check this out. I did this for you. I thought you'd appreciate it. Didn't ask for anything. Return and I reach out to them and said, Hey, what do you do for work? Like, would you like to come work for me? That's how shit works, right? Is like this person took the initiative to go out of the way to do something that was a massive project and took their time and their effort and their thoughtfulness and just saying that's for nothing in return.

Ben Pakulski: And then I went a little bit, went out of my way, look like I'll pay you whatever you want to come work for me. Right. That's the framing that ultimately we're trying to get to. It's like if you want something, you know. Gary Vaynerchuk, give, give. Give, give. Ask. Right. So that's his jab, jab, jab, jab. Right hook. I think it's three jobs in order to give, give, give, give, ask. And that's it. Right. So if that's life, that's business, that's relationships. That's you know, this is not a give you give, give, take it. Give, give, give, give. Ask. Right. That's business. That's relationships. That's everything. That's the great kind of place to be able to understand how to move forward with any new relationship.

Ashleigh VanHouten: And, you know, you may not even have to do the asking part, because if you're doing all this giving, oftentimes people are going to like you said, people are going to respect and appreciate what you're doing and give back without you having to ask. So that's another thing to consider. But I think the other kind of downside to this culture that you're talking about and sort of the last thing I wanted to talk about in terms of coaching and mentoring and why that's important, I think that because there's so much information out there in the world right now that's free. The idea of paying top dollar for a coach for a program is tough for a lot of people to swallow. But I think that it's all about what you invest is what you get back. Right. So if you expect to do your first bodybuilding show by like watching a couple people on Instagram and just kind of winging it, like the results are going to be what you would expect, right. Like you need to invest in things that you're accountable and especially if it's your own money, like you have somebody else paying for your competition, prep like, OK. But when you're paying for it with your own money and you've invested in this person, you've researched this coach, and you said, look, I put the money down, I've paid for the show like this is happening. I think that people need to be more willing to if you put your foot down and said this is important to me, the investment in the money that you're putting into it should reflect that. And I think that too many of us think like, hey, we can just kind of figure it out because everything's for free. I can download a couple PDAF from the Internet and like figure it out. That's not how people become successful.

Ben Pakulski: Well, the reason that is. Because this influence or lifestyle that so many people lead, people get the shit thrown at them. Right now I think about that in relation to like my camps that I do all around the world that we don't have tons coming out early 2020, Dubai, Australia, we're doing Bali now ASH, which we fund.

Ben Pakulski: So people like could I get a huge amount was exposure by inviting some big, big influencers and going, Hey man, you got ten million fans. Come to my camp for free in exchange for shut up. Yeah, great. What's going to happen? They're going to come and I can respect my time. They're not gonna learn anything. They're not going appreciate information because they haven't invested. So no matter who you are and I'm guilty of this, too, if I've ever been given anything for free, I'm much less likely to sit there and appreciate it and invest in work and actually get everything out of it.

Ben Pakulski: So it's almost a disservice to give somebody something for free riders like this idea of, well, you know, they're just going to show up and respect it. And I did that once. At the end of it, I was like, man, I feel terrible about this. Like, I don't ever want to do that again. I always want to pay for anything. I get people you get this like I have people at Rich all the time. Hey, we won't send you free stuff nine times at times, you know, like. No, thanks. I can pay for it if I wanted if I want to trade protocal, try it. And if I like it, I'll reach out to you and say, Hey, I really like your product. Would you mind? Would you be honest and critic relationship? But I want to try it. First, I want to pay for it from my own pocket. And like literally, there's countless sponsors who reach out. You get it. You see this? Like we send you free stuff for shadow. I'm like, absolutely not. No interest rate. Whereas if I try it and I buy it and I like it, you know, maybe I'll reach out. I think that's a very different empowering place to come with the world. But they're just always taking you taking and taking, and now you're ultimately giving away your power. Because I can't afford it. People can send me stuff. And now you start to expect it.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. I couldn't agree more. OK. So I know we have to wrap this up pretty soon. But are you gonna get Alvin on the podcast? I guess I'm putting you on the spot here, but...

Ben Pakulski:  I would like Alvin to be on the podcast every day.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. Hey, hey, look, we don't need somebody to take my job just yet. All right. Alvin can come off as well.

Ben Pakulski: So, honestly, I have never met a man who's read more books, who has more experience, who just just as wealth of information in every area. Like he's the guy who saved the relationship with my dad. I wouldn't talk to my dad right now if it wasn't for Alvin. I would never say a word to him the day that I was going to stop talking to my dad, I wouldn't see all that and ask for his advice. Alvin took me through some stuff and I went and we've had a great relationship ever since my dad and I have. And like the guys, just absolutely amazing. And I will have one at some point. His kid was crazy. And if I do it like I want him to be sitting beside me. I don't wanna do it remotely. It's just too impersonal. I want to sit beside me so I can appreciate him more than ever.

Ben Pakulski: But yeah, it'll happen.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Awesome. Cool. All right. Well, I mean, enjoy Columbia. Did you bring your fresh press with you to Columbia? I forgot to ask you the only one. Only one bottle. Last glass of what? Like the trip over there on the plane?

Ben Pakulski: No, I'm rationing it. So I've been here, what, eight, nine days now and I've got maybe like a maybe an eighth of a bottle left.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Geeze, what are you gonna do?

Ben Pakulski: I didn't want to bring six bottles. So I'm like what do I do?

Ben Pakulski: I don't know. I'm drinking a lot of water. Not even a lot of food. And that's kind of the end of this. So I just think maybe I'll do something fast on this one.

Ashleigh VanHouten: All right. Good luck with that. I don't know. I don't know how you're gonna survive without your, you know, quart of olive oil per day. But we'll see what happens. I guess you'll let us know.

Ben Pakulski: Yeah, well, it is what it is.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Good luck.

Ben Pakulski: Thanks, Ash.

Ashleigh VanHouten: I almost am out of fresh breast, even though I do not use 16 tablespoons per meal, but I have been literally basically just doing like a tablespoon around meals because I want to actually taste it tastes so good that I almost don't want to like hide it in a salad or on top of food. So I've been doing like literally health shots at this olive oil because it's got so good.

Ben Pakulski: And yeah, I'm I put it on everything and I try not to, I  a little bit of salt on it. No vinegars or anything. No, no dressing them like that.

Ben Pakulski: That's like my it's my condiment. I did my meat, you know, drizzled on my eggs or my cabbage and my whatever. Everything.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Yeah. And I noticed a lot of people on social media are posting pictures of the oil that they got because they did the the fancy. If you got to get fresh thirty five, you can get like the full bottle, which is usually like thirty nine bucks, you get it for a dollar. Like there is literally no way you can get better quality olive oil.

Ashleigh VanHouten: So yeah I saw people posting it and I've seen people like people have messaged me too because again people think that I'm just like direct line to band. They're like, hey, is Ben like cool in real life? Does he have like good Cavs and real life? And I'm like, well, he's overrated anyway now. Now I'm only nice. But yeah, people are reaching out to me and they're like, I can't believe how different this tastes from the stuff that I've been using. So, I mean, like, they're really you can't overhype this stuff. Like, it actually is the best quality olive oil I've ever had.

Ben Pakulski: No doubt. I'm not going to talk this much good stuff about something and not actually be true to my word. You know that.

Ashleigh VanHouten: Good point, BPak. All right. So we're done here. But anybody who wants to get this before it runs out, because I think it's pretty close, actually. Get fresh. Thirty five and get your olive oil.
